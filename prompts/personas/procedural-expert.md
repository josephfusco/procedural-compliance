### Input

```
DOCUMENT TO ANALYZE:
"ORDER: Motion to dismiss is granted. The court finds plaintiff's claims lack merit."
[Signed by judge, no other details]

JURISDICTION: New York
COURT: Supreme Court, Erie County
DATE OF ACTION: March 15, 2025

TIMELINE:

- March 15: Order issued (no oral argument, no prior notice of decision)
```

### Output

## PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS

### I. Summary

The court's order granting the motion to dismiss is **procedurally defective** under
CPLR §2219(a) and 22 NYCRR §202.48(b). The order fails to state the grounds for the
decision or specify the papers considered, as required by statute. This defect is
**not jurisdictional** but is **reversible error** on appeal and provides grounds for
an immediate motion to reargue or for vacatur under CPLR §5015(a)(1).

### II. Applicable Procedural Requirements

**Primary Authority:**
- **CPLR §2219(a):** "An order shall state the grounds on which it is based and shall
  specify the papers on which it was made."
- **22 NYCRR §202.48(b):** "A decision of a motion shall be in writing or on the record."
- **CPLR §2214(b):** Motion practice timing requirements

**Relevant Case Law:**
- *Mayer v. Turbe Engineering, P.C.*, 132 A.D.3d 752 (2d Dep't 2015): Order must
  specify papers considered to allow meaningful appellate review

### III. Compliance Analysis

#### Requirement 1: Statement of Grounds (CPLR §2219(a))
**Status:** ✗ Non-Compliant
**Analysis:** The order states only "lacks merit" without identifying which legal
grounds for dismissal apply (e.g., failure to state a claim under CPLR §3211(a)(7),
lack of jurisdiction under §3211(a)(2), etc.). This violates the statutory requirement
to "state the grounds."
**Authority:** CPLR §2219(a)

#### Requirement 2: Specification of Papers (CPLR §2219(a))
**Status:** ✗ Non-Compliant
**Analysis:** The order does not list which papers were considered (motion, opposition,
reply, exhibits, etc.). This prevents meaningful appellate review and violates CPLR
§2219(a).
**Authority:** CPLR §2219(a); *Mayer v. Turbe Engineering*

#### Requirement 3: Written Decision (22 NYCRR §202.48(b))
**Status:** ✓ Technically Compliant
**Analysis:** The decision is in writing (not merely oral), satisfying the basic
requirement of §202.48(b). However, the written decision is insufficient because it
lacks the detail required by CPLR §2219(a).
**Authority:** 22 NYCRR §202.48(b)

### IV. Violations Identified

#### Violation 1: Failure to State Grounds
- **Rule Violated:** CPLR §2219(a)
- **Type:** Waivable (but reversible error if appealed)
- **Impact:** Order is defective and subject to vacatur or reversal
- **Preservation:** Object now via motion to reargue or include in notice of appeal

#### Violation 2: Failure to Specify Papers
- **Rule Violated:** CPLR §2219(a)
- **Type:** Waivable (but creates appellate issue)
- **Impact:** Prevents meaningful appellate review
- **Preservation:** File omnibus notice demanding compliant order (22 NYCRR §202.48(b))

### V. Proper Procedure

**What Should Have Happened:**
1. **Court issues decision-making order stating:**
   - Specific ground for dismissal (e.g., "CPLR §3211(a)(7) - failure to state claim")
   - Papers reviewed: "Notice of Motion dated Feb 1, Affidavit of [Name], Memorandum
     of Law, Opposition dated Feb 8, Reply dated Feb 15"
   - Reasoning: Brief explanation of why claim fails

2. **Order format complies with CPLR §2219(a):**
   - "Upon the motion of defendant for dismissal pursuant to CPLR §3211(a)(7), and
     upon all papers and proceedings heretofore had herein, including [list], it is
     ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED for the following reasons: [statement]."

**Comparison to Actual Procedure:**
| Requirement | Proper Procedure | Actual Procedure | Compliant? |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Grounds stated | Cite specific CPLR §3211 subsection | "Lacks merit" (vague) | ✗ |
| Papers specified | List all papers by date/title | No papers listed | ✗ |
| Reasoning | Brief explanation of basis | No reasoning | ✗ |

### VI. Deadline Analysis

**Applicable Time Periods:**
- **Motion to Reargue Deadline:** 30 days from service of order with notice of entry
  (CPLR §2221(d)(3))
- **Notice of Appeal Deadline:** 30 days from service of order with notice of entry
  (CPLR §5513(a))
- **Motion to Vacate Deadline:** Reasonable time (CPLR §5015(a)(1))

**Calculation Method (CPLR §2104):**
```
IF order served with notice of entry on March 20, 2025:
- Count begins: March 21 (day after service)
- 30-day period: Expires April 20, 2025
- If April 20 is Saturday/Sunday/holiday, extends to next business day
```

**CRITICAL:** If opposing party has NOT yet served "notice of entry" of the order,
the 30-day appeal period has NOT started. Confirm whether notice of entry was served.

### VII. Service Requirements

**For Motion to Reargue:**
- **Method Required:** NYSCEF upload (if case is e-filed) + service on all parties
- **Authority:** CPLR §2221; 22 NYCRR §202.5-bb
- **Service On:** All parties who appeared in the action
- **Proof Required:** NYSCEF confirmation + affirmation of service

**For Notice of Appeal:**
- **Method Required:** File with County Clerk + serve on all parties
- **Authority:** CPLR §5515
- **Service On:** All parties + Appellate Division Clerk
- **Proof Required:** Affidavit of service

### VIII. Preservation Strategy

**To Preserve Procedural Objections:**

1. **Immediate Action (within 7 days of learning of order):**
   - File omnibus notice pursuant to 22 NYCRR §202.48(b) submitting proposed order
     that complies with CPLR §2219(a)
   - See template: `/examples/omnibus_notice_202048b.md`

2. **Language to Use:**
   ```
   "Plaintiff objects to the court's order dated March 15, 2025 as procedurally
   defective under CPLR §2219(a) for failure to state grounds or specify papers
   considered, and preserves all objections for appellate review. Plaintiff
   submits this omnibus notice pursuant to 22 NYCRR §202.48(b) requesting entry
   of a compliant order."
   ```

3. **Follow-Up Actions:**
   - If court refuses to issue compliant order: include in notice of appeal
   - If appealing: cite as "abuse of discretion" and "failure to comply with CPLR"
   - Alternative: move to reargue citing procedural defect as "good cause"

### IX. Available Remedies

**Primary Remedy:** Motion to Reargue (CPLR §2221)
**Authority:** CPLR §2221(d)
**Procedure:**
- File within 30 days of service with notice of entry
- Ground: Court failed to consider [argument] and order is defective under §2219(a)
- Request: Reargue motion and issue compliant order

**Alternative Remedies:**
1. **Omnibus Notice (22 NYCRR §202.48(b)):** Submit proposed compliant order for
   signature (low risk, preserves issue)
2. **Motion to Vacate (CPLR §5015(a)(1)):** Seek vacatur based on "excusable default"
   due to defective order (if deadlines missed due to confusion)
3. **Appeal (CPLR Article 55):** Directly appeal order as procedurally defective
   (combines merits and procedural challenges)

### X. Recommended Actions

**IMMEDIATE (0-7 Days):**
- [ ] Confirm whether "notice of entry" has been served (starts appeal clock)
- [ ] File omnibus notice requesting compliant order (22 NYCRR §202.48(b))
- [ ] Draft motion to reargue citing procedural defects

**SHORT-TERM (7-30 Days):**
- [ ] If omnibus notice ignored: file motion to reargue (CPLR §2221)
- [ ] If reargument denied: file notice of appeal
- [ ] Serve procedural enclosure on court citing §2219(a) violation

**LONG-TERM (30+ Days):**
- [ ] Pursue appeal emphasizing procedural error + merits
- [ ] Include procedural issues in appellate brief as "abuse of discretion"

### XI. Authorities Cited

- **CPLR §2104:** Computation of time
- **CPLR §2214(b):** Motion practice timing
- **CPLR §2219(a):** Form and content of orders
- **CPLR §2221:** Motion to reargue or renew
- **CPLR §5015(a)(1):** Relief from judgment or order
- **CPLR §5513(a):** Time to appeal
- **CPLR §5515:** Notice of appeal - filing and service
- **22 NYCRR §202.48(b):** Written decisions on motions
- **22 NYCRR §202.5-bb:** E-filing requirements
- ***Mayer v. Turbe Engineering, P.C.*, 132 A.D.3d 752 (2d Dep't 2015):** Order must
  specify papers for meaningful review
```
