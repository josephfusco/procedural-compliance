```

### Output

```markdown
## STRATEGIC MEMORANDUM

### I. Procedural Posture

You have multiple strong procedural violations:
- Ex parte order without notice (violates due process)
- No written findings (violates CPLR §2219(a))
- No hearing on merits (violates FCA and due process)
- Judge refusing to comply with procedural demands

This creates a clean record for appellate and federal intervention.

### II. Strategic Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear procedural violations well-documented
- Constitutional claims (14th Amendment due process)
- Multiple enforcement avenues available
- Timeline shows prompt action after learning of order

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Custody is currently disrupted (creates urgency)
- Judge is hostile to procedural demands
- Pro se status may affect credibility
- Time pressure for child welfare

**Opportunities:**
- CPLR §5704(a) motion to vacate ex parte order
- Appellate Division emergency intervention
- Federal preliminary injunction (if state remedies exhausted)
- Judicial conduct complaint creates accountability pressure

### III. Recommended Action Plan

#### Immediate Actions (0-7 Days)

1. **File CPLR §5704(a) Motion (Day 1-2)**
   - Motion to vacate ex parte order
   - Include demand for hearing with notice
   - Cite: CPLR §5704(a), §2214(a), §2219(a), 22 NYCRR §202.7(f)

2. **Submit Omnibus Notice for Written Orders (Day 1-2)**
   - Pursuant to 22 NYCRR §202.48(b)
   - Propose orders for court signature
   - Creates record of non-compliance

3. **File Emergency Stay Application to Appellate Division (Day 3-5)**
   - If trial court denies §5704(a) motion
   - Request interim custody restoration pending appeal
   - Cite: CPLR §5519(a)(1)

#### Short-Term Strategy (8-30 Days)

1. **Prepare Notice of Appeal (Day 10-14)**
   - Appeal denial of §5704(a) motion (if denied)
   - Appeal underlying custody order
   - Cite: CPLR §5701, Family Court Act §1112

2. **Document Judicial Non-Compliance (Ongoing)**
   - Maintain log of all court refusals
   - Serve procedural enclosures for each violation
   - Preserve for appellate record

3. **Consider Article 78 Mandamus (Day 20-30)**
   - Compel issuance of written orders
   - Separate proceeding if judge continues refusal
   - Cite: CPLR Article 78

#### Long-Term Positioning (30+ Days)

1. **Federal Court Strategy (If State Remedies Fail)**
   - 42 U.S.C. §1983 action for due process violations
   - Preliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65
   - Jurisdictional basis: 28 U.S.C. §1331, §1343

2. **Judicial Conduct Complaint**
   - File with NYS Commission on Judicial Conduct
   - Document violations of 22 NYCRR Part 100 (judicial ethics)
   - Creates accountability and settlement pressure

3. **Appellate Brief Development**
   - Focus on preservation of constitutional issues
   - Cite federal cases on parental rights (Troxel, Stanley, etc.)
   - Build record for certiorari if necessary

### IV. Legal Authorities

- **CPLR §5704(a)**: Right to move to vacate ex parte orders
- **CPLR §2219(a)**: Orders must state grounds and papers considered
- **22 NYCRR §202.48(b)**: Decisions must be in writing or on record
- **22 NYCRR §202.7(f)**: Ex parte applications require notice affidavit
- **Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976)**: Due process requires notice and hearing
- **Matter of Mark C., 28 N.Y.3d 279 (2016)**: Procedural due process in family court

### V. Risk Analysis

**Potential Obstacles:**
- **Judge may retaliate for procedural demands**
  - *Mitigation*: Document everything; creates stronger appellate/federal record

- **Appellate Division may defer to trial court**
  - *Mitigation*: Emphasize constitutional issues; seek de novo federal review if needed

- **Time pressure may force bad settlement**
  - *Mitigation*: Move quickly on emergency stay; don't compromise on fundamental rights

### VI. Record Preservation Checklist

- [ ] Upload all documents to NYSCEF (creates timestamped record)
- [ ] Request transcripts of all court proceedings
- [ ] Maintain chronological log of all events
- [ ] Preserve copies of all court orders (even if unsigned/informal)
- [ ] Document all attempts to obtain compliance
- [ ] Include preservation language in every filing

### VII. Next Steps

**THIS WEEK:**
1. Draft and file CPLR §5704(a) motion (use template from /examples)
2. Serve omnibus notice for written orders (22 NYCRR §202.48(b))
3. Prepare emergency stay application for Appellate Division

**NEXT WEEK:**
4. If motion denied, immediately file emergency stay with Appellate Division
5. Serve procedural enclosure on judge for continued non-compliance
6. Begin drafting notice of appeal

**ONGOING:**
7. Document every procedural violation in writing
8. Maintain communication log
9. Prepare for federal court if state remedies fail

**CRITICAL:** Do not wait for court cooperation. Proceed to next level (appellate/federal)
as soon as lower court refuses compliance. Delay harms both your case and your child.
