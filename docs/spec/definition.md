# Procedural Compliance Framework (PCF) — Technical Specification

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Stable
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## 1. Definition

**Procedural Compliance Framework (PCF)** — A neutral specification and template set that documents required procedural duties under statute and rule, compels performance or written justification, and creates a verifiable record of compliance or omission.

PCF is a documentation framework, not a pleading recognized by the CPLR.

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Neutrality
PCF does not evaluate motives, outcomes, or individuals. It verifies whether required procedural steps occurred, in writing, within statutory timeframes.

### 2.2 Verifiability
Each template maps to an objectively verifiable rule (e.g., CPLR §2219(a), FRCP 52(a), 22 NYCRR §202.48(b)) and generates reproducible records.

### 2.3 Openness
PCF operates as open-source software under MIT License. Changes follow a public changelog and review process modeled on RFCs.

---

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 Applicability
PCF is applicable across courts and agencies. Jurisdiction-tagged modules (NY, Federal) clarify use.

### 3.2 Role-Based Templates
Templates target specific actors in the legal system:
- **Judges**: CPLR §2219(a), FRCP 52(a) (written orders and findings)
- **Clerks**: CPLR §5017(b), FRCP 58/79 (record maintenance)
- **Counsel**: RPC 1.1-1.4, 3.3-3.4 (professional duties)
- **Attorneys for Children**: FCA §§241-249, 22 NYCRR §7.2(d)
- **Oversight Bodies**: 22 NYCRR Part 100, Part 1200 (judicial and attorney conduct)

---

## 4. Template Structure

### 4.1 YAML Front Matter
All templates include machine-readable metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Template Name"
jurisdiction: "NY" | "Federal"
role: "judge" | "clerk" | "counsel" | "afc" | "oversight" | "procedural" | "universal"
statutes: ["CPLR §2219(a)", "22 NYCRR §202.48(b)"]
version: "1.0.0"
---
```

### 4.2 Jurisdiction Banners
Templates include jurisdiction-specific banners:

**New York:**
```
**JURISDICTION: NEW YORK**
This template applies to New York State courts (Supreme, Family, Appellate Division)
governed by CPLR, DRL, FCA, and 22 NYCRR.
```

**Federal:**
```
**JURISDICTION: FEDERAL**
This template applies to United States District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals
governed by FRCP, FRAP, and Federal Rules of Evidence.
```

### 4.3 Standard Sections
1. **Legal Authority**: Governing statutes and rules
2. **Identified Non-Compliance**: Specific failures documented
3. **Demand for Compliance**: Required actions with timeframes
4. **Record Preservation**: Notice for appellate/administrative review
5. **Opportunity to Cure**: Good-faith period before escalation

---

## 5. Governance

### 5.1 Versioning
PCF follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes to template structure
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes and citation updates

### 5.2 Changes and Review
Changes are tracked in CHANGELOG.md. Significant changes undergo public review period modeled on IETF RFCs.

### 5.3 Contribution Requirements
All contributions must include:
- Statute/rule citations with verified text
- Jurisdiction tags (NY, Federal, or jurisdiction-specific)
- Neutral tone (no accusatory language)
- Example filled outputs (for new templates)

---

## 6. Use Cases

### 6.1 Procedural Enforcement
Document compliance failures and create record evidence for appeals, mandamus, or oversight complaints.

### 6.2 Record Preservation
Preserve objections to procedural violations for appellate review under CPLR §5501, FRAP 4(a).

### 6.3 Administrative Accountability
Create formal complaints to judicial conduct commissions, attorney grievance committees, or agency oversight bodies.

---

## 7. Non-Use Cases

PCF is **not**:
- A substitute for legal representation
- A recognized pleading under CPLR or FRCP
- A guarantee of favorable outcomes
- Legal advice or attorney-client communication

---

## 8. Technical Architecture

### 8.1 Machine-Readable Format
Templates use YAML front matter for:
- Automated jurisdiction filtering
- Role-based template selection
- Citation verification
- Version tracking

### 8.2 Citation Database
Machine-readable citations in `/docs/citations/`:
- `statutes.json`: CPLR, NYCRR, USC, FRCP, FRAP
- `cases.json`: Key precedents with holdings
- `rules.json`: Local court rules by jurisdiction

### 8.3 Validation
Templates undergo:
- Citation verification against official sources
- Legal accuracy review
- Neutral tone review
- Technical validation (YAML structure, placeholders)

---

## 9. Maintenance

### 9.1 Citation Updates
Citations are verified against official sources and updated as needed. Last verification: January 2025.

### 9.2 Rule Changes
Templates are updated when underlying statutes or rules change. Updates are documented in CHANGELOG.md.

### 9.3 Deprecation Policy
Obsolete templates are marked deprecated and moved to `/deprecated/` with explanation.

## 10. License and Disclaimer

**License:** MIT License (see LICENSE file)

**Disclaimer:** PCF provides legal procedure templates for informational purposes. It does not constitute legal advice. Consult qualified counsel regarding your specific circumstances and jurisdiction.

**Educational civic-tech resource. Not legal advice.** Use jurisdiction-specific templates with local rules. Remove personal/child PII before sharing.

---

## 11. Objective

Define a transparent, repeatable standard for procedural accountability so due process can be **demonstrated, not debated**.
