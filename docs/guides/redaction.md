- **Social Security numbers** must be redacted (last 4 digits only)
- **Financial account numbers** must be redacted (last 4 digits only)
- **Dates of birth** should be redacted to year only

## How to Redact Documents

### 1. Before Redaction: Identify PII

Review document for:
- ☐ Social Security Numbers
- ☐ Financial account numbers (bank, credit card)
- ☐ Dates of birth
- ☐ Names of minor children
- ☐ Addresses of protected persons
- ☐ Medical record numbers
- ☐ Driver's license numbers
- ☐ Passport numbers
- ☐ Biometric data

### 2. Redaction Methods

**✅ Proper Redaction (PDF):**
1. Use Adobe Acrobat's "Redact" tool (not just black boxes)
2. Apply redactions permanently
3. Verify redaction by viewing "redaction properties"
4. Save as new file with "_redacted" suffix

**❌ Improper Redaction:**
- Black boxes or highlights (can be removed)
- White-out or covering text (can be uncovered)
- Deleting text in Word (metadata may preserve)
- Highlighting and changing font color to white (text still searchable)

**⚠️ Metadata Risk:**
- Metadata may contain unredacted information
- Always flatten PDF before filing
- Consider: File > Save As > Reduced Size PDF

### 3. Verification

After redaction, verify:
- ☐ Text is permanently removed (not just hidden)
- ☐ No metadata contains redacted information
- ☐ Document is flattened (not editable)
- ☐ Search function does not find redacted text
- ☐ All required identifiers redacted per FRCP 5.2 or NY rules

### 4. Retain Unredacted Version

- Keep unredacted version for your records
- May be required to provide to court upon request (under seal)
- **Never** file unredacted version publicly

## Special Redaction Issues

### Exhibits with PII

**Problem:** Opponent's document (e.g., bank statement, medical record) contains PII.

**Solution:**
1. Redact before filing as exhibit
2. Note in filing: "Exhibit A (redacted per FRCP 5.2)"
3. File unredacted under seal if necessary for case

### Transcripts

**Court Reporters:** Responsible for redacting transcripts per Local Rules.

**Parties:** May request additional redactions within time specified by Local Rule (typically 21 days).

### Sealed Documents vs. Redacted Documents

| Sealed | Redacted |
|--------|----------|
| Entire document not publicly accessible | Sensitive portions removed; rest is public |
| Requires motion and court order | Filer's responsibility; no motion needed |
| High bar to overcome First Amendment | Standard practice for PII |
| Use for trade secrets, confidential settlement | Use for SSN, financial accounts, minors |

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Filing Unredacted, Then Refiling
**Problem:** First filing is already public. Refiling redacted version does not undo exposure.

**Solution:** Redact BEFORE first filing. No second chances.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Black Boxes Over Text
**Problem:** Black boxes in PDF can be removed by recipient, revealing text.

**Solution:** Use Adobe Acrobat's "Redact" tool, which permanently removes text.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Assuming Confidential = Sealed
**Problem:** Documents in Family Court or matrimonial cases are not automatically redacted. Confidentiality rules govern access, not PII protection.

**Solution:** Apply redaction rules even in confidential proceedings.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Checking Metadata
**Problem:** PDF metadata may contain unredacted information in document properties or tracked changes.

**Solution:** Flatten PDF and check metadata (File > Properties).
