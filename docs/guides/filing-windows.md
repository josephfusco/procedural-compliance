## Calculating Deadlines

### Business Days vs. Calendar Days

- **CPLR**: Most deadlines use **calendar days** unless rule specifies "business days"
- **FRCP/FRAP**: Most deadlines use **calendar days**; FRCP 6(a) provides calculation method

### Exclusions and Extensions

**New York (CPLR §2103):**
- Exclude day of service/event
- Include last day (unless weekend/holiday, then next business day)
- If service by mail: add 5 days to response deadline (CPLR §2103(b)(2))

**Federal (FRCP 6(a)):**
- Exclude day of service/event
- Include last day (unless weekend/holiday, then next business day)
- If service by electronic means (CM/ECF): add 3 days to response deadline (FRCP 6(d))

### Weekends and Holidays

If deadline falls on:
- **Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday**: Deadline moves to **next business day**

**New York Legal Holidays:** CPLR §25-a (includes Election Day in some counties)
**Federal Legal Holidays:** FRCP 6(a)(6) (references federal statutes)

## Common Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Service of Notice of Entry

**NY:** Time to appeal typically **does not begin** until opponent serves notice of entry of order/judgment with proof of service. CPLR §5513(a).

**Exception:** Even without notice of entry, appeal time is limited by CPLR §5513(c) (varies by case type).

**Pro Tip:** If opponent hasn't served notice of entry, consider whether strategic value exists in waiting OR serve notice yourself to start clock.

### ⚠️ "Entry" vs. "Service"

**NY:** "Entry" means filed with clerk. "Service" means delivered to parties. These are different dates with different consequences.

**Federal:** "Entry" means on docket (FRCP 79, FRCP 58). FRAP 4(a)(7) clarifies when judgment/order is "entered."

### ⚠️ Automatic Extensions Don't Always Apply

**NY:** Extensions under CPLR §2103(b)(2) (add 5 days for mail service) apply to **responses to papers**, not filing deadlines like notice of appeal.

**Federal:** FRCP 6(d) (add 3 days for electronic service) applies to **responses**, not filing deadlines like notice of appeal (FRAP 26(c)).

## Emergency Relief

### Order to Show Cause (NY)

**No set deadline.** Court may entertain emergency applications on short notice or ex parte when:
- Irreparable harm
- Time-sensitive matter
- Public interest
- See 22 NYCRR §202.7(f)

### Temporary Restraining Order (Federal)

**FRCP 65(b):** May be granted without notice to adverse party if:
- Immediate and irreparable injury will result
- Specific facts shown by affidavit/verified complaint
- Applicant's attorney certifies efforts to give notice

**Duration:** Maximum 14 days (FRCP 65(b)(2))
