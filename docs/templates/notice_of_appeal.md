# NOTICE OF APPEAL

**[NY][CPLR] Appeal to Appellate Division Pursuant to CPLR Article 55**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Notice of Appeal

**USE this template when:**
- Trial court issued order/judgment you believe is legally erroneous
- Order is appealable as of right or by permission (check CPLR §5701)
- You are within 30-day deadline from service of notice of entry
- You have exhausted post-trial motions (if applicable)
- Appellate review could result in reversal, modification, or remand

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Appeal deadline has passed (30 days from notice of entry, not from decision date)
- Order is non-appealable interlocutory order (CPLR §5701(a))
- You haven't received notice of entry yet (wait for it to start appeal clock)
- You want to re-argue merits to trial court (file motion to reargue instead)
- Issue wasn't preserved in trial court (need contemporaneous objection)

**Appropriate example:** Trial court granted summary judgment dismissing your case; notice of entry served 15 days ago; you believe ruling was legal error.

**Inappropriate example:** Judge made oral ruling 2 weeks ago but no written order entered yet (wait for written order and notice of entry).

### Critical Timing and Prerequisites

**STRICT DEADLINES - MISS THESE AND LOSE YOUR APPEAL:**

1. **30-day deadline:** File notice of appeal within 30 days of service of notice of entry with written order (CPLR §5513(a))
   - Clock starts from service of "Notice of Entry" - NOT from decision date
   - If no notice of entry served, 5 years from entry of judgment
   - Extensions rarely granted; deadline is jurisdictional

2. **Preserve issues below:** Must have made contemporaneous objection/motion in trial court
   - Can't raise new issues on appeal
   - Exception: subject matter jurisdiction, questions of law from undisputed facts

3. **File in correct court:**
   - Supreme Court → Appellate Division for your department
   - Family Court → Appellate Division (check FCA for which orders are appealable)
   - Confirm which department has jurisdiction over your county

4. **Serve all parties:** Notice of appeal must be served on all parties and filed with trial court clerk

### Resource Requirements & Realistic Expectations

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** 9-12 months for briefing, 6-12 months for decision after submission
- **Cost:** Transcript costs ($3-5/page), printing costs, potential undertaking for stay
- **Success rate:** ~20-30% reversal rate overall; higher if clear legal error
- **Perfection requirements:** Must order transcripts, prepare record, file briefs within strict deadlines
- **What this achieves:** Appellate review of legal errors; potential reversal, modification, or new trial
- **What this does NOT do:** Allow you to present new evidence; retry facts; guarantee reversal

**What happens after filing notice of appeal:**
1. **Order transcripts** (within 10 days of notice of appeal - CPLR §5525)
2. **Prepare record on appeal** (assemble all relevant papers from trial court)
3. **File appellant's brief** (9 months after notice of appeal in most departments)
4. **Respondent files brief** (typically 60 days after appellant's brief)
5. **Appellant's reply brief** (optional, typically 30 days)
6. **Oral argument** (if requested and granted)
7. **Decision** (typically 6-12 months after full submission)

**Costs to expect:**
- **Transcripts:** $3-5 per page (typically $1,000-5,000+ for trial)
- **Record on appeal:** Printing/assembly costs
- **Poor person relief:** May waive costs if you qualify (CPLR §1101)
- **Stay undertaking:** If seeking stay, may need to post bond (CPLR §5519)

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Motion to reargue:** Ask trial court to reconsider (CPLR §2221) - 30 days from service with notice of entry
- **Motion for renewal:** Based on new facts (CPLR §2221)
- **Settle the judgment:** Negotiate resolution before appeal
- **Consult appellate attorney:** Appeals are technical; mistakes can be fatal

**Best practice:** File notice of appeal early (don't wait until day 30); consult experienced appellate counsel; understand this is just first step in lengthy process.
