# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE — COURT CLERK

**[NY][CPLR] Demand for Proper Record Entry and Access**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Notice to Court Clerk

**USE this template when:**
- Clerk failed to enter filed documents in docket or NYSCEF
- Docket entries are incorrect (wrong dates, parties, document types)
- Clerk denied access to public court records without legal basis
- Orders were issued but not entered in the record
- Clerk's errors may affect your case or appellate rights

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Error was just discovered and you haven't informally requested correction
- Documents are sealed or legitimately exempt from public access
- Clerk explained legal basis for denial and it's valid
- This is about clerk's personality or customer service (not legal compliance)
- Issue is with judge's decision (not clerk's ministerial duties)

**Appropriate example:** Filed motion 3 weeks ago via NYSCEF; not entered in docket; clerk has not responded to 3 emails requesting correction.

**Inappropriate example:** Clerk was rude when you called (that's not non-compliance with legal duties).

### Try These Steps First

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Check NYSCEF/docket** to confirm error exists
2. **Email clerk's office** politely requesting correction with case details
3. **Call clerk's office** if no email response within 5 business days
4. **Visit courthouse** in person to request correction (if feasible)
5. **Speak to supervising clerk** if line clerk doesn't respond
6. **Document the issue** with screenshots, docket printouts, filing receipts

**Document everything:** Save emails, note phone calls, keep filing confirmations.

### Resource Requirements & Realistic Expectations

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** Correction may take 1-2 weeks after notice; could be immediate
- **Success rate:** High for clear ministerial errors; lower for access denials with legal basis
- **Clerk authority:** Clerks have ministerial duties but judges control many record decisions
- **What this achieves:** Creates record; usually prompts correction; supports Article 78 if ignored
- **What this does NOT do:** Force clerk action immediately; override judicial seal orders

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Informal requests first:** Usually fastest resolution (email/call/visit)
- **Speak to court attorney:** For issues requiring judicial input
- **Motion to court:** For substantive relief (e.g., motion to unseal records)
- **Article 78 proceeding:** If clerk refuses ministerial duty with no legal basis
- **Appellate counsel:** For advice on preserving record for appeal

**Best practice:** Use this only after informal methods fail; clerk errors are usually inadvertent and quickly corrected with polite request.
