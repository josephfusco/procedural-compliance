## AFFIDAVIT/AFFIRMATION IN SUPPORT

STATE OF NEW YORK  )
                   ) ss.:
COUNTY OF {{COUNTY}} )

{{Name}}, being duly sworn/affirms under penalty of perjury, deposes and says:

### I. BACKGROUND

1. I am the {{movant / attorney for movant}} in this action and have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein.

2. On {{date}}, this Court issued an {{order/judgment}} {{granting defendant's motion / dismissing complaint / etc.}} (Exhibit B).

3. On {{date}}, I filed a Notice of Appeal to the Appellate Division, {{Department}} Department (Exhibit A).

4. I now move for a stay of enforcement of the {{order/judgment}} pending appeal.

### II. LEGAL STANDARD

5. CPLR §5519(a)(1) authorizes this Court to stay enforcement of a judgment or order "upon such terms as may be just."

6. To obtain a stay, movant must demonstrate:
   - Likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal
   - Irreparable injury absent a stay
   - Balance of equities favors a stay
   - Public interest (if applicable)

*William Karl Realty Corp. v. 420 W. 204th St. Realty LLC*, 132 A.D.3d 561 (1st Dep't 2015); *Doe v. Axelrod*, 73 N.Y.2d 748 (1988).

### III. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON APPEAL

7. Movant has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal because:

**[Provide specific appellate issues with supporting law]**

**Issue 1:** {{e.g., "The trial court erred in granting summary judgment where genuine issues of material fact remain"}}

**Analysis:** {{Brief explanation of why this is likely to be reversed. Cite cases where similar errors led to reversal.}}

**Issue 2:** {{e.g., "The trial court violated CPLR §2219(a) by failing to state grounds for decision"}}

**Analysis:** {{Explanation + authority}}

**Issue 3:** {{Additional issues}}

8. {{Supporting case law showing similar issues resulted in reversal}}

9. Absent the complained-of errors, the outcome would have been different.

### IV. IRREPARABLE INJURY

10. Absent a stay, movant will suffer irreparable injury that cannot be compensated by money damages:

**{{Describe specific irreparable harms - e.g.:
- "Loss of parental rights/custody pending appeal (cannot be remedied if appeal succeeds)"
- "Enforcement of judgment will force sale of property"
- "Defendant will be judgment-proof by time of appeal"
- "Constitutional rights will be violated pending review"}}**

11. These harms are imminent. Without a stay, {{specific harm will occur}}.

12. Money damages cannot remedy these harms because {{why damages are inadequate}}.

### V. BALANCE OF EQUITIES

13. The balance of equities favors a stay:

**Harm to Movant (if no stay):**
- {{Harm 1}}
- {{Harm 2}}

**Harm to Respondent (if stay granted):**
- {{Minimal harm / Delay only / Can be compensated / etc.}}

14. Movant's harm is {{greater/irreversible}} while respondent's harm is {{lesser/remediable}}.

15. {{If applicable: Movant offers undertaking to protect respondent's interests.}}

### VI. PUBLIC INTEREST

16. {{If applicable: The public interest favors/does not oppose a stay because {{reason - e.g., "ensuring constitutional rights are not violated pending appeal" / "maintaining stability for minor child" / etc.}}}}

### VII. NO ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE

17. No alternative remedy exists. Without a stay, the appealed {{order/judgment}} will be enforced, rendering the appeal moot or meaningless.

### VIII. TERMS OF STAY

18. Movant proposes the following terms for the stay:

{{If undertaking required:
- "Movant will post undertaking in the amount of ${{X}} pursuant to CPLR §5519(a)(1)"}}

{{Other conditions:
- "Movant will perfect appeal within {{X}} months"
- "Status quo will be maintained"
- etc.}}

### IX. NOTICE AND SERVICE

19. This motion is made on {{X}} days' notice to all parties. Service was made via {{method}} on {{date}}.

WHEREFORE, movant respectfully requests that this Court grant a stay of enforcement of the {{order/judgment}} pending appeal, upon such terms as the Court deems just.
