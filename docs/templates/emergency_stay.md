# MOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL

**[NY][CPLR] Emergency Stay Pursuant to CPLR §5519**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Motion for Stay Pending Appeal

**USE this template when:**
- You filed notice of appeal and need to stop enforcement of judgment/order
- Enforcement would cause irreparable harm that can't be undone if you win appeal
- You have likelihood of success on appeal (not frivolous)
- Harm to you from enforcement exceeds harm to other party from delay
- Judgment involves custody, property sale, or other irreversible action

**DO NOT use this if:**
- You haven't filed notice of appeal yet (file that first)
- Appeal is frivolous or weak (courts won't stay for unlikely appeals)
- Money damages alone are at stake (usually not irreparable)
- You can't post required undertaking (if court requires one)
- No immediate enforcement is threatened

**Appropriate example:** Court ordered custody transfer to other parent; you filed appeal; transfer scheduled in 5 days; you need stay to prevent irreversible custody change pending appeal.

**Inappropriate example:** Court awarded $10,000 money judgment; you filed appeal but opposing party hasn't tried to collect yet (no imminent irreparable harm).

### Legal Standard - You Must Prove ALL Four Elements

**To obtain stay, you MUST demonstrate:**

1. **Likelihood of success on appeal**
   - Not "guaranteed to win" but "substantial probability of reversal"
   - Clear legal error by trial court
   - Cite cases where similar errors were reversed

2. **Irreparable injury without stay**
   - Harm that can't be compensated by money
   - Examples: loss of custody, forced sale of home, constitutional violation
   - Must be imminent and concrete, not speculative

3. **Balance of equities favors stay**
   - Your harm from enforcement > their harm from delay
   - Consider: can you post undertaking to protect their interests?

4. **Public interest** (if applicable)
   - Maintaining constitutional rights
   - Child welfare (custody cases)
   - Usually neutral factor

**High bar to meet:** Courts disfavor staying judgments. You need strong showing on all elements.

### Timing and Procedure

**TIMING CRITICAL:**

1. **File notice of appeal FIRST** (required before stay motion)
2. **Move for stay immediately** (before enforcement occurs)
3. **Automatic stay option** (CPLR §5519(a)(1)):
   - If you serve notice of appeal within 30 days AND
   - File undertaking (bond) in required amount
   - Automatically stays money judgments (not custody, injunctions, etc.)

**WHERE TO MOVE:**
- **Trial court first** (CPLR §5519(a)(1)) - faster, same judge who decided case
- **Appellate Division** (CPLR §5519(a)(2)) - if trial court denies or you skip trial court
- **Both:** Can move in trial court first, then Appellate Division if denied

**NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Must give reasonable notice to all parties
- Emergency/ex parte stays rarely granted without notice
- Show good cause if seeking stay on shortened time

### Resource Requirements & Undertaking

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Undertaking (bond):** Court may require you to post bond to protect other party
  - Typically 110% of judgment amount for money judgments
  - May be waived for non-money judgments or if you're poor person
  - Must obtain from surety company (costs money)

- **Timeline:**
  - Emergency: Can get stay in days/weeks if truly urgent
  - Standard: 2-4 weeks for decision
  - If denied by trial court, move in Appellate Division immediately

- **Success rate:** ~30-40% if you have strong irreparable harm + good appeal

- **What this achieves:** Stops enforcement while appeal pending; preserves status quo

- **What this does NOT do:** Guarantee success on appeal; make enforcement impossible forever (only delays)

**Costs:**
- Undertaking/bond premiums (typically 1-2% of bond amount per year)
- Motion filing fees
- Possible transcript costs if court needs record

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Negotiate with other party:** Agree to voluntary stay pending appeal
- **Partial enforcement:** Agree to some enforcement with protections
- **Expedited appeal:** Request accelerated briefing schedule instead of stay
- **Supersedeas bond:** Automatic stay for money judgments (CPLR §5519(a)(1))

**Best practice:** File stay motion immediately after notice of appeal; demonstrate concrete imminent harm; offer reasonable undertaking; show strong likelihood of success on appeal.

## AFFIDAVIT/AFFIRMATION IN SUPPORT

STATE OF NEW YORK  )
                   ) ss.:
COUNTY OF {{COUNTY}} )

{{Name}}, being duly sworn/affirms under penalty of perjury, deposes and says:

### I. BACKGROUND

1. I am the {{movant / attorney for movant}} in this action and have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein.

2. On {{date}}, this Court issued an {{order/judgment}} {{granting defendant's motion / dismissing complaint / etc.}} (Exhibit B).

3. On {{date}}, I filed a Notice of Appeal to the Appellate Division, {{Department}} Department (Exhibit A).

4. I now move for a stay of enforcement of the {{order/judgment}} pending appeal.

### II. LEGAL STANDARD

5. CPLR §5519(a)(1) authorizes this Court to stay enforcement of a judgment or order "upon such terms as may be just."

6. To obtain a stay, movant must demonstrate:
   - Likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal
   - Irreparable injury absent a stay
   - Balance of equities favors a stay
   - Public interest (if applicable)

*William Karl Realty Corp. v. 420 W. 204th St. Realty LLC*, 132 A.D.3d 561 (1st Dep't 2015); *Doe v. Axelrod*, 73 N.Y.2d 748 (1988).

### III. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON APPEAL

7. Movant has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal because:

**[Provide specific appellate issues with supporting law]**

**Issue 1:** {{e.g., "The trial court erred in granting summary judgment where genuine issues of material fact remain"}}

**Analysis:** {{Brief explanation of why this is likely to be reversed. Cite cases where similar errors led to reversal.}}

**Issue 2:** {{e.g., "The trial court violated CPLR §2219(a) by failing to state grounds for decision"}}

**Analysis:** {{Explanation + authority}}

**Issue 3:** {{Additional issues}}

8. {{Supporting case law showing similar issues resulted in reversal}}

9. Absent the complained-of errors, the outcome would have been different.

### IV. IRREPARABLE INJURY

10. Absent a stay, movant will suffer irreparable injury that cannot be compensated by money damages:

**{{Describe specific irreparable harms - e.g.:
- "Loss of parental rights/custody pending appeal (cannot be remedied if appeal succeeds)"
- "Enforcement of judgment will force sale of property"
- "Defendant will be judgment-proof by time of appeal"
- "Constitutional rights will be violated pending review"}}**

11. These harms are imminent. Without a stay, {{specific harm will occur}}.

12. Money damages cannot remedy these harms because {{why damages are inadequate}}.

### V. BALANCE OF EQUITIES

13. The balance of equities favors a stay:

**Harm to Movant (if no stay):**
- {{Harm 1}}
- {{Harm 2}}

**Harm to Respondent (if stay granted):**
- {{Minimal harm / Delay only / Can be compensated / etc.}}

14. Movant's harm is {{greater/irreversible}} while respondent's harm is {{lesser/remediable}}.

15. {{If applicable: Movant offers undertaking to protect respondent's interests.}}

### VI. PUBLIC INTEREST

16. {{If applicable: The public interest favors/does not oppose a stay because {{reason - e.g., "ensuring constitutional rights are not violated pending appeal" / "maintaining stability for minor child" / etc.}}}}

### VII. NO ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE

17. No alternative remedy exists. Without a stay, the appealed {{order/judgment}} will be enforced, rendering the appeal moot or meaningless.

### VIII. TERMS OF STAY

18. Movant proposes the following terms for the stay:

{{If undertaking required:
- "Movant will post undertaking in the amount of ${{X}} pursuant to CPLR §5519(a)(1)"}}

{{Other conditions:
- "Movant will perfect appeal within {{X}} months"
- "Status quo will be maintained"
- etc.}}

### IX. NOTICE AND SERVICE

19. This motion is made on {{X}} days' notice to all parties. Service was made via {{method}} on {{date}}.

WHEREFORE, movant respectfully requests that this Court grant a stay of enforcement of the {{order/judgment}} pending appeal, upon such terms as the Court deems just.
