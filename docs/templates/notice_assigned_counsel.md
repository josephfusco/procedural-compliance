# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE — ASSIGNED COUNSEL

**[NY] Demand for Competent Representation and Communication**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Notice to Assigned Counsel

**USE this template when:**
- Assigned counsel hasn't contacted you in weeks/months despite your attempts
- Counsel missed court dates or failed to file important motions
- You disagree with counsel's strategy and they won't explain or discuss
- Counsel won't return calls/emails about case status
- You need to create record of communication failures before seeking new counsel

**DO NOT use this if:**
- You simply disagree with counsel's legal advice (that's not misconduct)
- Counsel explained their strategy and you just don't like it
- You want counsel to lie, file frivolous motions, or violate ethics
- This is first communication problem (try calling/emailing first)
- You're upset about losing (outcome ≠ incompetence)

**Appropriate example:** Assigned counsel hasn't returned 10+ calls over 3 months; missed last court date; you don't know case status.

**Inappropriate example:** Counsel advised plea deal you don't want (they're allowed to recommend strategy you disagree with).

### Try These Steps First

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Multiple contact attempts:** Call, email, show up to office (document each attempt)
2. **Contact supervisor:** If public defender, contact their supervisor
3. **Court appearance:** Ask judge at next appearance about getting counsel to respond
4. **Write informal letter:** Send non-threatening letter asking for meeting
5. **Understand their obligations:** Read RPC 1.1-1.4 to confirm actual violation

**Document everything:** Save voicemails, emails, screenshots showing attempts to contact.

### Resource Requirements & Consequences

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** Counsel may respond within days; or you may need to seek substitution
- **Relationship:** This will likely damage attorney-client relationship
- **Motion to substitute:** You may need to file motion if counsel doesn't improve
- **You're stuck with them until:** Court grants substitution (hard to get in criminal cases)
- **What this achieves:** Creates record for ineffective assistance claim; may prompt compliance
- **What this does NOT do:** Automatically get you new counsel or guarantee better representation

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Supervisor complaint:** If public defender, complain to their office first
- **Motion to relieve:** Ask court to appoint new counsel (need good cause)
- **Grievance complaint:** For serious misconduct (abandonment, fraud, etc.) - use Attorney Grievance template
- **Consult attorney:** If you can afford private counsel, that's fastest solution

**Best practice:** Use this as last resort before seeking counsel substitution; it documents your attempts to work with assigned counsel.
