# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE — OPPOSING COUNSEL

**[NY] Demand for Good Faith Compliance with Discovery and Procedural Rules**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Notice to Opposing Counsel

**USE this template when:**
- Opposing counsel failed to respond to discovery requests within statutory timeframe
- Counsel made misrepresentations to court that remain uncorrected
- Discovery responses are inadequate and no good faith meet-and-confer occurred
- Counsel violated court orders regarding disclosure or filing deadlines
- Pattern of professional misconduct affecting your case

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Discovery deadline hasn't passed yet or extension was granted
- You disagree with objections but haven't met and conferred
- Misstatement was corrected or is immaterial to the case
- This is strategic disagreement about legal interpretation
- You haven't attempted informal resolution first

**Appropriate example:** Discovery requests served 60 days ago; no response despite 3 follow-up emails and court deadline; need to preserve record before motion to compel.

**Inappropriate example:** Opposing counsel filed brief arguing different legal interpretation than you prefer (that's advocacy, not misconduct).

### Try These Steps First

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Review court rules** to confirm deadlines and requirements
2. **Email opposing counsel** requesting compliance with specific deadline
3. **Meet and confer** in good faith about discovery disputes (often required before motions)
4. **Send letter before action** giving reasonable additional time to comply
5. **Check for extensions** that may have been granted
6. **Document all attempts** at informal resolution

**Document everything:** Discovery requests, responses, emails, meet-and-confer notes.

### Resource Requirements & Consequences

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** May resolve in days or require motion to compel (weeks/months)
- **Costs:** May lead to motion practice with associated time and fees
- **Relationship:** Will damage professional relationship with opposing counsel
- **Court preference:** Judges strongly prefer parties resolve discovery disputes informally
- **What this achieves:** Creates record for motion to compel; may prompt compliance; preserves sanctions argument
- **What this does NOT do:** Compel production (need court order); guarantee sanctions

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Meet and confer:** Good faith discussion often resolves discovery disputes
- **Stipulated extension:** Agree to reasonable additional time
- **Motion to compel:** If informal methods fail (CPLR §3124)
- **Sanctions motion:** For egregious violations (CPLR §3126, 22 NYCRR §130-1.1)
- **Grievance complaint:** Only for serious ethical violations (22 NYCRR Part 1240)

**Best practice:** Use this after good faith attempts to resolve informally; preserves record before motion to compel; demonstrates reasonable efforts to avoid court intervention.
