## 2. Identified E-Filing Violations

The following violations of mandatory e-filing rules have occurred as of {{date}}:

### Violation 1: {{If applicable - Improper Acceptance of Paper Filing}}

**Rule:** Uniform Rule 202.5-bb(a) requires mandatory electronic filing for all case types designated in Administrative Orders.

**Violation:**
On {{date}}, {{court clerk / opposing party}} accepted paper filing of {{document type}} in violation of mandatory e-filing requirements for this case type.

**Effect:**
- Improper paper filing delays docketing and notice to parties
- Violates mandatory e-filing rules established by Administrative Order
- Deprives parties of timely electronic notice via NYSCEF

**Authority:** Uniform Rule 202.5-bb(a): "All parties... shall use NYSCEF for the filing of all documents with the court."

### Violation 2: {{If applicable - Improper Rejection of E-Filed Document}}

**Rule:** Uniform Rule 202.5-d establishes limited grounds for rejection of e-filed papers.

**Violation:**
On {{date}}, the Clerk rejected my e-filing (Filing Confirmation No. {{NYSCEF confirmation number}}) for the following stated reason: "{{Rejection reason provided}}."

**Why Rejection Was Improper:**
{{Example reasons:
- Document complies with all formatting requirements (PDF/A, searchable text, proper font size)
- Rejection reason is not among grounds listed in Uniform Rule 202.5-d
- Technical issue was on court's end, not filer's
- Document was timely filed before deadline}}

**Effect:**
- Missed filing deadline due to improper rejection
- Inability to serve opposing counsel via NYSCEF
- Denial of access to courts

**Authority:** Uniform Rule 202.5-d permits rejection only for:
1. Technical defects (wrong file format, corrupted file, etc.)
2. Missing required information
3. Untimely filing
4. Incorrect fee payment

The stated rejection reason ("{{rejection reason}}") does not fall within these permissible grounds.

### Violation 3: {{If applicable - Failure to Use NYSCEF Email Service}}

**Rule:** Uniform Rule 202.5-b(h)(2) requires parties to accept service via NYSCEF email service address.

**Violation:**
{{Opposing counsel / Party name}} has failed to:
- Maintain active NYSCEF email service address
- Accept service via NYSCEF
- {{Other violation - e.g., "demanded paper service in mandatory e-filing case"}}

**Effect:**
- Delays in service of interlocutory papers
- Violation of e-filing protocols
- Increased costs for all parties

**Authority:** Uniform Rule 202.5-b(h)(2): "Service of interlocutory papers upon a user shall be made electronically."

### Violation 4: {{If applicable - Technical Access Issues / System Down}}

**Rule:** When NYSCEF is unavailable, paper filing is permitted but court must accept it.

**Violation:**
On {{date}}, NYSCEF was unavailable from {{time}} to {{time}} ({{attach screenshot or NYSCEF status notice}}).

I timely attempted to e-file {{document}} but was unable due to system outage. I then:
- {{Tendered paper copy to clerk}}
- {{Emailed clerk/chambers notifying of technical issue}}
- {{Other reasonable attempt to file}}

The court {{refused to accept / rejected / other improper action}} the filing despite NYSCEF unavailability.

**Effect:**
- Missed filing deadline due to technical failure beyond filer's control
- Denial of access to courts
- Prejudice to party's substantive rights

**Authority:** Uniform Rule 202.5-b(c)(1): If NYSCEF is unavailable, "the clerk shall accept the document in another form."

### Violation 5: {{If applicable - Other E-Filing Violations}}

{{Examples:
- Failure to docket e-filed document within required timeframe
- Improper marking of document as "sealed" or "restricted"
- Denial of access to public court records via NYSCEF
- Charging fees for documents that should be free
- Requiring in-person appearance for task that can be done via NYSCEF}}

## 4. Legal Authority

### Uniform Rule 202.5-bb - Mandatory E-Filing

> **202.5-bb(a):** "All parties... shall use NYSCEF for the filing of all documents with the court."

> **202.5-bb(d):** Paper filing is permitted only in limited circumstances: (1) emergency applications when NYSCEF unavailable, (2) working copies, (3) certain exhibits, (4) documents filed by self-represented litigants who received an exemption.

Mandatory e-filing is not optional. Administrative Orders designate case types requiring NYSCEF, and compliance is required.

### Uniform Rule 202.5-b - General E-Filing Provisions

> **202.5-b(c)(1):** "If on a given day NYSCEF is unavailable... the clerk shall accept the document in another form."

> **202.5-b(h)(2):** "Service of interlocutory papers upon a user shall be made electronically."

Service via NYSCEF email is mandatory for parties registered as users. Paper service of interlocutory papers is not permitted except for non-users.

### Uniform Rule 202.5-d - Rejection Standards

Rejection is permitted only for:
- **Technical defects:** Wrong format, corrupted file, illegible text
- **Missing information:** Caption incomplete, signature missing, incorrect fee
- **Untimely filing:** Filed after deadline
- **Incorrect fee:** Wrong amount or payment method

All other rejections are **improper** and violate filer's right of access to courts.

### Chapter 237 of the Laws of 2015

Consolidated e-filing requirements into substantive statutes (CPLR, SCPA, etc.), making NYSCEF compliance a statutory obligation, not merely a rule of practice.

## 6. Opportunity to Cure

Before filing judicial or administrative complaints, I am providing this opportunity to cure violations:

**3-Day Cure Period:**

If you:
1. Comply with all demands in Section 3 within three (3) business days;
2. Provide written confirmation of compliance; and
3. Cease further violations;

Then I will consider the matter resolved without filing motions or administrative complaints.

1. File Order to Show Cause seeking nunc pro tunc filing date for improperly rejected documents
2. File administrative complaint with NYSCEF Resource Center

## 7. Service and Filing

This Procedural Enclosure is:

- **{{E-filed / Served}}** via NYSCEF on {{date}}
- **Served** on all parties via NYSCEF
- **{{Tendered in paper}}** if NYSCEF unavailable {{or if recipient improperly refusing e-service}}
- **Copy provided** to {{NYSCEF Resource Center / Clerk's Office / Chambers}} as courtesy

---

## CONCLUSION

Uniform Rule 202.5-bb establishes **mandatory** e-filing for designated case types. The word "shall" in the rule is not discretionary.

Improper rejection of compliant e-filings, acceptance of paper filings when e-filing is required, and refusal to accept electronic service all violate the Uniform Rules and deprive parties of access to courts.

I respectfully request that you comply with NYSCEF rules by {{accepting e-filing / re-processing improperly rejected filing / accepting electronic service / accepting paper filing due to system outage}} within three (3) business days.
