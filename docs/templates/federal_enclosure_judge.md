# PROCEDURAL ENCLOSURE - FEDERAL JUDGE

**TO:** The Honorable {{Judge Name}}
{{Title - District Judge / Magistrate Judge}}
**FROM:** {{Your Name}}
**DATE:** {{Date}}
**CASE:** {{Caption}}, Case No. {{Case Number}}
**COURT:** United States District Court for the {{District}} District of {{State}}
**SUBJECT:** Procedural Notice and Demand for Compliance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

---

## 1. Judicial Authority and Duties

You preside over the above-captioned matter as {{District Judge / Magistrate Judge}}, bound by:

- **Federal Rules of Civil Procedure**, particularly FRCP 52(a) (findings of fact and conclusions of law)
- **Federal Rules of Evidence**
- **Local Rules** for the {{District}} District of {{State}}
- **28 U.S.C. §455** (judicial disqualification)
- **Code of Conduct for United States Judges**
- **Due Process Clause** of the Fifth Amendment

---

## 2. Identified Non-Compliance

The following duties required by federal law have not been performed as of {{date}}:

**Issue 1: Failure to Provide Written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law**

Pursuant to FRCP 52(a)(1):

> "In an action tried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, **the court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately**. The findings and conclusions may be stated on the record after the close of the evidence or may appear in an opinion or a memorandum of decision filed by the court."

Despite {{bench trial concluding on {{date}} / evidentiary hearing on {{date}}}}:

- No written findings of fact have been filed
- No conclusions of law have been separately stated
- No opinion or memorandum of decision appears in the record (ECF docket as of {{date}})
- {{Oral ruling was made / No ruling at all}} but FRCP 52(a) requires written findings

**Effect on Appellate Review:**

FRCP 52(a)(1) exists specifically to facilitate appellate review. *See Anderson v. City of Bessemer*, 470 U.S. 564, 571 (1985) ("The court of appeals' role in reviewing findings of fact is quite restricted..."). Without findings and conclusions:

- Appellant cannot adequately brief issues for Circuit Court review
- Appellate court lacks basis to apply "clearly erroneous" standard to factual findings
- Legal conclusions cannot be reviewed *de novo* because they are not separately stated
- Judgment is procedurally defective

**Issue 2: {{If applicable - other procedural violations}}**

{{Examples:
- Ex parte communications without notice
- Denial of motion without explanation or legal basis
- Failure to provide notice and opportunity to be heard
- Bias or appearance of impropriety requiring recusal under 28 U.S.C. §455}}

---

## 3. Demand for Compliance

You are hereby demanded to:

**A. Issue Written Findings and Conclusions (FRCP 52(a))**

Within **fourteen (14) business days** of service of this notice:

1. File written findings of fact addressing {{contested factual issues - e.g., "witness credibility, weight of evidence, factual disputes regarding exhaustion of remedies"}}.

2. File separate conclusions of law addressing {{legal issues - e.g., "application of qualified immunity, burden of proof, statutory interpretation"}}.

3. File findings and conclusions on {{CM/ECF}} so they are part of the official appellate record.

**OR**

Provide written explanation of why FRCP 52(a) does not apply to this proceeding, including:
- Statutory or rule-based authority for oral decision without written findings
- Factual basis showing proceeding was not "tried on the facts" requiring FRCP 52(a)

**B. {{Additional Demands if Applicable}}**

{{Examples:
- Recuse yourself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §455(a) and provide written basis for prior non-recusal
- Provide opportunity to be heard on {{issue decided ex parte}}
- Issue ruling on pending Motion No. {{X}}, filed {{date}}, which remains pending {{X}} days without decision}}

---

## 4. Legal Authority

**FRCP 52(a) - Mandatory Requirement**

FRCP 52(a)(1) uses the mandatory word "**must**": the court **must** find facts specially and **state** conclusions separately. This is not discretionary.

*Kelley v. Everglades Drainage Dist.*, 319 U.S. 415, 422 (1943): "The importance of [FRCP 52(a)] cannot be overestimated... It is designed to aid the appellate court... This end is served only when the findings... are detailed and stated separately."

*United States v. El Paso Nat. Gas Co.*, 376 U.S. 651, 656-57 (1964): Findings "are the pillars of the decision," and their absence makes appellate review impossible.

{{Circuit}} Circuit precedent: {{Insert circuit case requiring FRCP 52(a) compliance}}

**Due Process - Notice and Opportunity to be Heard**

{{If applicable}} The Fifth Amendment requires notice and opportunity to be heard before adverse action. *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). {{Your ex parte ruling / failure to hold hearing / other violation}} deprived {{party}} of due process.

**28 U.S.C. §455 - Recusal**

{{If applicable}} A judge must recuse when "impartiality might reasonably be questioned." 28 U.S.C. §455(a). {{Facts creating appearance of bias}} require recusal.

## 5. Record Preservation and Further Relief

This Procedural Enclosure serves as:

- **Formal notice** of procedural non-compliance for appellate review
- **Preservation** of objection to procedural defects pursuant to FRCP 46
- **Predicate** for the following relief if compliance is not forthcoming:

**Administrative Remedies:**
1. Complaint to {{Circuit}} Judicial Council pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §351 (judicial misconduct and disability)
2. Complaint to Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability

**Appellate Remedies:**
3. Notice of Appeal to {{Circuit}} Circuit Court of Appeals citing procedural violations
4. Mandamus petition to Circuit Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1651 (All Writs Act) to compel compliance with FRCP 52(a)

**Direct Relief:**
5. Motion for Reconsideration emphasizing mandatory nature of FRCP 52(a)
6. Motion to Recuse pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §455 {{if applicable}}

---

## 6. Preservation of Objections

Pursuant to FRCP 46, a party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court of the action the party wishes the court to take. This Procedural Enclosure formally informs the Court of:

1. **Objection to lack of written findings and conclusions** required by FRCP 52(a).
2. **Demand for compliance** within fourteen (14) business days.
3. **Preservation** of all appellate and administrative remedies if compliance is not forthcoming.

---

## 7. Service and Filing

This Procedural Enclosure is:

- **Filed** via CM/ECF on {{date}}
- **Served** on all parties via CM/ECF
- **Served** on {{Judge Name}} via {{chambers email / ECF notice / other approved method per local rules}}

**Note:** {{District}} Local Rules {{permit/require}} {{method of communicating with chambers}}.

---

## CONCLUSION

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) exists to ensure meaningful appellate review and prevent arbitrary decision-making. The Supreme Court has called findings of fact "the pillars of the decision" and emphasized their mandatory nature.

Compliance with this procedural rule is not a request for judicial discretion—it is a demand for performance of a ministerial duty imposed by the Federal Rules.

I respectfully request that the Court comply with FRCP 52(a) by filing written findings of fact and conclusions of law within fourteen (14) business days.
