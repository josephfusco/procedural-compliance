## 2. Identified Non-Compliance

The following clerk duties required by federal law have not been performed as of {{date}}:

**Issue 1: Failure to Enter Judgment (FRCP 58)**

Pursuant to FRCP 58(b)(1):

> "When the court awards only a sum certain or denies all relief, **the clerk—unless the court orders otherwise—must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment**."

Despite {{court decision on {{date}} / jury verdict on {{date}}}}:

- {{X}} days have elapsed since {{decision/verdict}}
- No written court order directing clerk **not** to enter judgment appears in the record
- FRCP 58(c)(2)(A) deadline (150 days for FRCP 4(a)(1) appeal deadline) is at risk

**Effect on Parties:**

Without entry of judgment:
- Appeal time under FRAP 4(a)(1) has not begun to run
- Judgment is not final or enforceable
- Post-judgment remedies (execution, garnishment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 motions) are unavailable
- Parties are in procedural limbo

**Issue 2: Failure to Maintain Accurate Docket (FRCP 79)**

Pursuant to FRCP 79(a):

> "The clerk must keep a record of the court, to be known as the 'civil docket'... The clerk must enter in the docket all actions taken in the case."

The following docket errors/omissions exist:

- {{Example: Hearing held {{date}} not reflected on docket}}

**Effect on Parties:**

Inaccurate docket:

**A. Enter Judgment (FRCP 58)**

Within **five (5) business days** of service of this notice:

1. Prepare, sign, and enter judgment reflecting {{court's decision / jury verdict / default}}.

2. Ensure judgment appears as separate docket entry on CM/ECF.

---

## 4. Legal Authority

**FRCP 58 - Mandatory Clerk Duty to Enter Judgment**

FRCP 58(b)(1) uses the mandatory word "**must**": the clerk **must** "promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment." This is not discretionary when the court awards a sum certain or denies all relief.

*Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis*, 435 U.S. 381, 384 (1978): The separate document requirement of FRCP 58 "was designed to ensure that litigants can determine with certainty when a judgment has been entered."

{{Circuit}} Circuit precedent: {{Insert circuit case on FRCP 58 clerk duties}}

**FRCP 79 - Mandatory Docket Maintenance**

FRCP 79(a) requires the clerk to "keep a record" and "enter in the docket all actions taken in the case." This creates a ministerial duty to maintain accurate records.

*Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc.*, 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978): Common law right of access to judicial records. Accurate docketing is essential to this right.

**28 U.S.C. §751 - Clerk Duties**

> "The district court may appoint a clerk who shall be subject to removal by the court. The clerk... shall... perform the duties assigned to the clerk by the court."

Clerk's duties include those imposed by FRCP 58, 79, and local rules. These are ministerial, not discretionary.

**Public Access to Court Records**

E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. §3501 note, and Judicial Conference policy on public access require accurate, accessible electronic records.

## 5. Record Preservation and Further Relief

This Procedural Enclosure serves as:

- **Formal notice** of clerk non-compliance for administrative and judicial review
- **Preservation** of objection to docket errors and delayed judgment entry
- **Predicate** for the following relief if compliance is not forthcoming:

**Administrative Remedies:**
1. Complaint to {{District}} Chief Judge regarding clerk performance
2. Complaint to Circuit Judicial Council
3. Contact Administrative Office of U.S. Courts

**Judicial Remedies:**
4. Motion to Direct Clerk to Enter Judgment (FRCP 58)
5. Motion to Correct Docket (FRCP 79)
6. Mandamus petition to Circuit Court to compel ministerial duty (28 U.S.C. §1651)

**Direct Relief:**
7. Request for meeting with Clerk of Court to resolve issues
8. Escalation to Chief Deputy Clerk

---

## 6. Ministerial vs. Discretionary Duties

The duties demanded in this notice are **ministerial**, not discretionary:

**Ministerial Duty Defined:**

A ministerial duty is one "so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt." *Heckler v. Roe*, 465 U.S. 312, 314 (1984).

**Examples:**

- FRCP 58(b)(1): If court awards sum certain or denies all relief, clerk **must** enter judgment. No discretion.
- FRCP 79(a): Clerk **must** enter all actions in the docket. No discretion about whether to docket.
- Certified Copies: Clerk must provide upon request and payment. 28 U.S.C. §1914. No discretion to refuse.

**Contrast with Discretionary:**

Clerk has **no discretion** to:
- Refuse to enter judgment when FRCP 58(b)(1) applies
- Omit actions from the docket
- Deny access to public records
- Refuse certified copies upon proper request and payment

---

## 7. Service and Filing

This Procedural Enclosure is:

- **Filed** via CM/ECF on {{date}}
- **Served** on Clerk of Court via {{email / hand delivery / certified mail}}
- **Served** on all parties via CM/ECF
- **Copy provided** to {{Chief Judge / Clerk's Office Manager}} as courtesy

---

## CONCLUSION

The clerk's duties under FRCP 58 and 79 are ministerial and mandatory. The Federal Rules use the word "must" to denote these obligations, leaving no room for discretion or delay.

Entry of judgment and maintenance of accurate dockets are fundamental to the proper functioning of the federal courts. Failure to perform these duties impairs parties' rights and public access to justice.

I respectfully request that the Clerk's Office comply with FRCP 58 and 79 by {{entering judgment / correcting docket / providing records}} within five (5) business days.
