# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE (Universal - Federal)

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Federal Universal Notice

**USE this template when:**
- You need to address federal court actor (judge, clerk, counsel, agency) with procedural failure
- More specific federal template doesn't exist for your situation
- Federal rule, statute, or regulation was violated
- You need flexible template adaptable to federal procedure
- Creating record for multiple related federal compliance issues

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Specific federal template exists (judge, clerk, counsel - use those instead)
- Duty is unclear or disputed under federal law
- You haven't tried informal resolution appropriate to federal court
- This is about case outcome rather than procedural compliance
- Issue requires substantive motion rather than notice

**Appropriate example:** Federal magistrate judge failed to issue R&R within required timeframe; need notice addressing multiple procedural failures.

**Inappropriate example:** You lost motion in federal court and want to complain generally (use appeal or Rule 59/60 motion instead).

### Preparation Steps

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Check if specific template exists** (federal judge, clerk, opposing counsel)
2. **Identify specific FRCP/statute violated** with precise citation
3. **Document the failure** with ECF numbers, dates, docket references
4. **Attempt informal resolution** (email chambers, call clerk, meet and confer with counsel)
5. **Customize role module** from template to match federal rules
6. **Verify proper CM/ECF filing** requirements for district

**Document everything:** Federal rule requirements, CM/ECF confirmations, informal correspondence.

### Resource Requirements & Federal Court Considerations

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Customization required:** Framework template requiring significant adaptation to federal rules
- **Federal rules differ:** FRCP ≠ state procedure; verify federal authority
- **Less established:** Specific templates have more federal precedent support
- **CM/ECF filing:** Most federal courts require electronic filing
- **What this achieves:** Creates record for federal appellate/administrative review
- **What this does NOT do:** Provide detailed federal-specific guidance; guarantee success

**When to use specific federal templates instead:**
- **Federal Judge:** Use federal_notice_judge.md for FRCP 52(a) findings violations
- **Federal Clerk:** Use federal_notice_clerk.md for FRCP 58/79 violations
- **Federal Opposing Counsel:** Use federal_notice_opposing_counsel.md for discovery/ethics violations
- **AUSA/Federal Prosecutor:** Adapt opposing counsel template for Brady/Giglio violations

**Appropriate use cases for federal universal template:**
- Federal magistrate judge procedural violations
- Court reporter failed to produce federal transcript
- Federal probation officer violated procedural rules
- Multiple federal actors with related failures
- Unique federal role not covered by specific templates

**Federal vs. State differences:**
- Different rules: FRCP not CPLR
- Different timelines: Federal deadlines often shorter
- Different filing system: CM/ECF not NYSCEF
- Different local rules: Each federal district has own local rules
- Different appeal deadlines: 30 days (FRAP 4) not 30 days from notice of entry

**Best practice:** Prefer federal-specific templates when available; use universal only when necessary; heavily customize to federal rules; verify citations in FRCP/USC/FRAP.
