# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE (Universal - Federal)

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Federal Universal Notice

**USE this template when:**
- You need to address federal court actor (judge, clerk, counsel, agency) with procedural failure
- More specific federal template doesn't exist for your situation
- Federal rule, statute, or regulation was violated
- You need flexible template adaptable to federal procedure
- Creating record for multiple related federal compliance issues

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Specific federal template exists (judge, clerk, counsel - use those instead)
- Duty is unclear or disputed under federal law
- You haven't tried informal resolution appropriate to federal court
- This is about case outcome rather than procedural compliance
- Issue requires substantive motion rather than notice

**Appropriate Examples:**

✅ **USE Federal Universal Template:**
1. **Magistrate Judge R&R delay:** Magistrate failed to issue Report & Recommendation within 14-day deadline (28 U.S.C. §636(b)(1)(B)); District Judge won't intervene; need formal notice for record
2. **Federal probation officer violation:** Probation officer disclosed confidential pre-sentence report violating 18 U.S.C. §3552(d); supervised release conditions modified without proper hearing
3. **AUSA Brady/Giglio procedural failure:** Prosecutor failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in timely manner violating Brady v. Maryland and Model Rule 3.8; not about substance of evidence but timing/procedure
4. **Federal court reporter transcript delay:** Reporter missed 30-day deadline under 28 U.S.C. §753(b); ordered and paid 45 days ago; appeal deadline approaching; need transcript immediately
5. **Multiple federal actors:** District Judge + Magistrate Judge + Clerk all failed to process emergency motion timely; single comprehensive notice more efficient than three separate ones
6. **Federal public defender unique violation:** CJA counsel failed to file notice of appeal after explicit client instruction violating 18 U.S.C. §3006A(d); different from general assigned counsel template
7. **Federal agency officer (administrative context):** SSA ALJ failed to issue written decision within 60 days violating 20 C.F.R. §404.957; need notice before filing APA review
8. **Bankruptcy trustee procedural violation:** Trustee failed to timely abandon property under 11 U.S.C. §554; ministerial duty not discretionary decision
9. **Federal mediator exceeded authority:** Mediator disclosed confidential ADR communications violating ADR Act (28 U.S.C. §652); unique role not covered elsewhere

❌ **DO NOT Use Federal Universal Template:**
1. District Judge won't issue FRCP 52(a) findings → **Use federal_notice_judge.md** (specific template exists)
2. Federal clerk won't enter judgment under FRCP 58 → **Use federal_notice_clerk.md** (role-specific template)
3. Opposing counsel discovery abuse under FRCP 26 → **Use federal_notice_opposing_counsel.md** (specific template)
4. You lost summary judgment motion → **Use federal_notice_of_appeal.md** (this is appeal, not compliance)
5. Judge denied your motion and you disagree → **Use FRCP 59(e) motion to alter/amend** (not procedural notice)
6. Duty is disputed under federal law → **File motion or appeal** (universal notice won't resolve legal dispute)

### Try These Steps First

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Verify no specific federal template exists**
   - Check federal-specific templates: judge, clerk, opposing counsel, emergency stay, mandamus, notice of appeal, FOIA
   - Review whether federal mandamus (28 U.S.C. §1361) is more appropriate remedy
   - If specific template exists, use that (better federal precedent support)

2. **Identify specific FRCP/statute/regulation violated**
   - **Federal Rules:** FRCP 52(a), FRCP 58, FRCP 79, FRAP 3, FRAP 4, etc.
   - **U.S. Code:** 28 U.S.C. §636, 28 U.S.C. §753, 18 U.S.C. §3006A, etc.
   - **Code of Federal Regulations:** 20 C.F.R. (SSA), 8 C.F.R. (immigration), 29 C.F.R. (labor), etc.
   - **Example:** "28 U.S.C. §636(b)(1)(B) requires magistrate to file R&R within 14 days"
   - Federal courts require precise citation to federal authority (not state law)

3. **Determine if duty is ministerial or discretionary under federal law**
   - **Ministerial (federal):** Duty "plainly prescribed" (*Heckler v. Roe*, 465 U.S. 312)
   - **Discretionary (federal):** Requires judgment, policy weighing, prosecutorial/judicial discretion
   - Federal courts strictly enforce ministerial/discretionary distinction for mandamus
   - If discretionary, universal notice won't work - need appeal or APA review

4. **Document the failure with CM/ECF precision**
   - **ECF docket numbers:** Doc. 45, Doc. 52, etc. (not just dates)
   - **Electronic filing confirmations:** Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) timestamps
   - **Chambers communications:** Emails to @[district].uscourts.gov addresses
   - **Federal deadlines:** Count business days under FRCP 6(a), not calendar days
   - Build detailed timeline with ECF references

5. **Attempt federal court-appropriate informal resolution**
   - **For District Judge:** Email chambers (check local rules for procedure); many districts prohibit direct contact
   - **For Magistrate Judge:** Same as District Judge; check if referral from District Judge required
   - **For Clerk:** Email [district]_Help@[circuit].uscourts.gov; call clerk's office
   - **For AUSA:** Email directly; meet and confer required before discovery motions under many local rules
   - **For CJA counsel:** Contact CJA administrator; may need to file motion for substitution
   - **For agency:** Follow agency-specific procedures (e.g., SSA reconsideration, EOIR motion to reopen)
   - Document all informal attempts - federal courts expect exhaustion

6. **Customize role module for federal law**
   - See Section "Role Modules" below for federal judge/clerk/AUSA/agency frameworks
   - Replace {{placeholders}} with federal statute citations (not CPLR/state law)
   - Add circuit-specific precedent if available
   - Remove irrelevant modules (e.g., don't include state RPC for federal actors)

7. **Verify proper CM/ECF filing requirements**
   - **Filing method:** Most federal districts require CM/ECF filing (not paper)
   - **Service:** Automatic via NEF for registered users
   - **Non-ECF parties:** Must serve via mail/email per local rules
   - **Chambers copies:** Some judges require courtesy email copies (check local rules)
   - **Event code:** Check district's CM/ECF event list for correct category

**Document everything:** FRCP/statute citations, ECF docket numbers, NEF confirmations, chambers emails, meet-and-confer correspondence.

### Resource Requirements & Federal Court Considerations

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Customization required:** Framework template requiring significant adaptation to federal rules (not fill-in-the-blank)
- **Federal-specific legal research:** Must research FRCP, USC, CFR, and circuit precedent independently
- **Less established:** Specific templates have more federal precedent; universal template is newer
- **Timeline:** Varies - magistrate judge may respond in days; agency may take months; federal courts generally faster than state
- **Success rate:** Moderate to low; federal courts skeptical of non-standard procedural filings; prefer motions to notices
- **CM/ECF technical requirements:** Must comply with district-specific formatting, PDF/A, size limits
- **What this achieves:** Creates record for appeal/mandamus; preserves procedural objections; may prompt compliance
- **What this does NOT do:** Guarantee relief; substitute for motions under FRCP; provide detailed federal guidance

**Cost Expectations:**
- **Filing fees:** Usually $0 (notices typically not charged separately; motions $402 in most districts)
- **CM/ECF registration:** Free but requires attorney admission or pro se registration
- **Service costs:** Electronic service free via NEF; paper service ~$10 certified mail
- **Attorney consultation recommended:** $300-800/hour for federal litigation specialist
- **Time investment:** 4-7 hours (federal procedure more complex than state)

**When to use specific federal templates instead:**

| Situation | Correct Template | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| District/Mag Judge won't issue FRCP 52(a) findings | federal_notice_judge.md | Supreme Court precedent (*Kelley*, *El Paso*) |
| Federal clerk won't enter judgment (FRCP 58) | federal_notice_clerk.md | *Bankers Trust* establishes ministerial duty |
| Opposing counsel discovery violations (FRCP 26/37) | federal_notice_opposing_counsel.md | FRCP 37 sanctions framework + Model Rules |
| Need emergency stay pending appeal | federal_emergency_stay.md | FRAP 8 + *Nken* four-factor test |
| Agency failed to respond to FOIA | federal_foia_request.md | 5 U.S.C. §552 specific procedures |
| Need mandamus for ministerial duty | federal_mandamus.md | 28 U.S.C. §1361 jurisdiction + *Heckler* test |
| Filing notice of appeal to Circuit | federal_notice_of_appeal.md | FRAP 3, 4 jurisdictional requirements |

**Appropriate use cases for federal universal template:**

1. **Magistrate Judge Procedural Violations**
   - R&R deadline violations (28 U.S.C. §636(b)(1)(B) 14-day requirement)
   - Exceeded authority under referral order
   - Failed to hold hearings on non-dispositive matters
   - *Why universal:* Federal judge template focuses on District Judges; magistrate procedural violations distinct

2. **Federal Court Reporter Failures**
   - Missed 28 U.S.C. §753(b) 30-day transcript deadline
   - Produced incomplete/inaccurate transcript
   - Refused to produce despite payment and court order
   - *Why universal:* No court reporter-specific federal template exists

3. **AUSA/Federal Prosecutor Procedural (Not Substantive) Violations**
   - **Brady/Giglio timing failures:** Disclosed exculpatory evidence day before trial (procedural violation of timeliness)
   - **Model Rule 3.8 violations:** Failed to disclose declination to defendant after charges dismissed
   - **Discovery delays:** Violated FRCP 16 discovery deadlines in criminal case
   - *Why universal:* Federal opposing counsel template is civil-focused; this covers criminal prosecution procedure
   - **Note:** Do NOT use for substantive Brady claims (that's suppression motion, not notice)

4. **Federal Probation/Supervised Release Violations**
   - Probation officer violated 18 U.S.C. §3552(d) confidentiality
   - Modified conditions without proper hearing under 18 U.S.C. §3583(e)
   - Failed to file required reports with court
   - *Why universal:* Unique federal criminal context not covered elsewhere

5. **Multiple Federal Actors with Related Failures**
   - District Judge + Magistrate both failed to rule on pending motions
   - Clerk + Court Reporter both failed deadlines affecting same appeal
   - AUSA + FBI agent both violated disclosure procedures
   - *Why universal:* Single comprehensive notice more efficient; preserves record for all

6. **Federal CJA/Public Defender Unique Violations**
   - Failed to file notice of appeal after explicit client instruction (18 U.S.C. §3006A ineffectiveness)
   - Refused to investigate alibi witnesses (Sixth Amendment + CJA standards)
   - Missed critical filing deadlines in federal criminal case
   - *Why universal:* Federal criminal defense differs from state assigned counsel template

7. **Federal Agency Officers (Administrative Law Context)**
   - **SSA ALJ:** Failed to issue decision within 60 days (20 C.F.R. §404.957)
   - **Immigration Judge:** Denied continuance without proper findings (8 C.F.R. Part 1003)
   - **EEOC investigator:** Missed 180-day investigation deadline
   - **VA adjudicator:** Failed to assist claimant in developing claim (38 C.F.R. §3.159)
   - *Why universal:* Agency-specific procedures vary; universal framework adaptable

8. **Bankruptcy Trustee/U.S. Trustee Violations**
   - Trustee failed to abandon property (11 U.S.C. §554)
   - U.S. Trustee failed to file required reports
   - Trustee disclosed confidential debtor information
   - *Why universal:* Bankruptcy-specific procedural violations

9. **Federal Mediator/Neutral Violations**
   - Mediator disclosed ADR confidential information (28 U.S.C. §652)
   - Settlement judge exceeded authority during ADR
   - Special master violated procedural orders
   - *Why universal:* Unique quasi-judicial federal roles

**Federal vs. State Differences (Critical):**

| Aspect | Federal (FRCP/USC) | State NY (CPLR) |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Written findings** | FRCP 52(a) | CPLR §2219(a) |
| **Appeal deadline** | 30 days from entry (FRAP 4) | 30 days from notice of entry |
| **Discovery rules** | FRCP 26 proportionality | CPLR Article 31 full disclosure |
| **E-filing** | CM/ECF mandatory | NYSCEF mandatory |
| **Business days** | FRCP 6(a) excludes holidays | CPLR §2404 includes Saturdays |
| **Mandamus statute** | 28 U.S.C. §1361 | CPLR Article 78 |
| **Standards** | *Heckler*, *Nken*, *Cheney* | *Holtzman*, *Doe v. Axelrod* |

**Best practice:**

1. **Prefer federal-specific templates when available** - Better Circuit precedent, established federal procedure
2. **Use universal only when necessary** - Unique federal role not covered elsewhere
3. **Cite federal authority exclusively** - No CPLR, DRL, or state cases (federal courts ignore state procedure)
4. **Research circuit-specific rules** - Each Circuit has own local rules and precedent
5. **Verify local rules compliance** - Federal districts have strict local rules (formatting, service, chambers contact)
6. **Consider mandamus alternative** - If ministerial duty clear, 28 U.S.C. §1361 mandamus may be stronger
7. **Preserve for Circuit appeal** - Even if compliance not achieved, notice creates record for FRAP 3 appeal
8. **Federal courts prefer motions** - If appropriate, file FRCP motion instead of informal notice
