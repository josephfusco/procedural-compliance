# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE — JUDGE

**[NY][CPLR] Demand for Written Decision with Findings**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Notice to Judge

**USE this template when:**
- Judge decided motions orally without written orders in NYSCEF/file
- Decisions affect substantive rights or may be appealed
- You've waited reasonable time (2-4 weeks) for written order
- You need written findings for appellate record
- Judge's ruling involves discretion that should be documented

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Oral ruling was made on the record (transcript exists)
- This is routine procedural matter (scheduling, adjournments)
- Written order already exists but you disagree with it (file appeal instead)
- You're seeking to re-argue the merits (this won't change the decision)
- No prejudice from lack of written order (harmless error)

**Appropriate example:** Judge decided dispositive motion #5 orally 6 weeks ago; no written order in NYSCEF; you need it for appeal.

**Inappropriate example:** Judge denied your motion last week and you want to argue about it (this isn't a motion for reconsideration).

### Try These Steps First

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Check NYSCEF/docket** to confirm no written order was entered
2. **Wait 2-4 weeks** after oral ruling (courts have backlogs)
3. **Email clerk** politely asking about status of written order
4. **Court appearance:** Ask court attorney/clerk when order will be issued
5. **Informal letter:** Send respectful letter to chambers requesting order

**Document everything:** Save emails, docket screenshots, and correspondence.

### Resource Requirements & Realistic Expectations

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** May take additional 2-8 weeks for judge to issue order after this notice
- **Success rate:** High if order truly missing; low if oral ruling was sufficient
- **Legal nuance:** CPLR §2219(a) primarily applies to final/dispositive orders
- **Harmless error:** Lack of written order may not be reversible error if no prejudice
- **What this achieves:** Creates record; may prompt written order; preserves issue for appeal
- **What this does NOT do:** Re-argue merits, guarantee reversal, or change judge's mind

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Appeal without written order:** Appellate Division can review from transcript/record
- **Motion to compel:** If judge repeatedly refuses to issue required orders
- **Article 78:** If ministerial duty to enter order is clear and judge still refuses
- **Consult attorney:** To evaluate if written order is truly necessary for your appeal

**Best practice:** Use this after informal methods fail and written order is truly necessary (not just preferred).
