# FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW REQUEST

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use FOIL Request

**USE this template when:**
- You need records held by NY state agency, municipal government, or local entity
- Records are not already publicly available online (check agency website first)
- You need formal statutory process with deadlines and appeal rights
- Agency denied informal request or didn't respond
- Records needed for litigation preparation, accountability, research, or public interest purposes

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Records are already online (check agency website, Open Data NY portal, SEQR databases)
- This is federal agency (use federal FOIA instead - 5 U.S.C. §552)
- You need court records (use CPLR §5017(b) request to clerk or judicial FOIL under 22 NYCRR §216.1)
- Records needed for active litigation discovery (use CPLR §3101 discovery or subpoena instead)
- You need urgent access (FOIL has 20+ business day timeline; may take months)
- This is personnel records about yourself (request directly from employer under different procedure)

**Appropriate example:** Need emails and meeting minutes from county planning board about denial of your zoning variance application; informal request to clerk ignored; no litigation pending yet; records likely exist and not exempt.

**Inappropriate example:** Seeking state police investigative file about pending criminal case (law enforcement exemption under POL §87(2)(e); records likely exempt).

### Try These Steps First

**Before filing FOIL request:**

1. **Check if records already public** - Agency website, NY Open Data portal, SEQR Environmental Notice Bulletin
2. **Identify correct agency** - Which state/local entity created or maintains the records?
3. **Contact FOIL officer informally** - Email or call; may get records faster and free
4. **Be specific** - Dates, subject matter, document types, parties, case/project numbers
5. **Check agency FOIL page** - Many have procedures, forms, or online portals
6. **Consider scope** - Broader requests take longer, cost more, more likely to trigger exemptions
7. **Estimate fees** - 25¢/page typical; can request fee waiver if in public interest

**Document everything:** Keep copies of request, acknowledgment, agency responses, denials for appeal.

### Resource Requirements & Realistic Expectations

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** 5 business days for acknowledgment; 20 business days for response (POL §89(3)); actual production may take months for complex requests
- **Cost:** Typically 25¢ per page for copies; can be $0-$1,000+ depending on volume; fees often waived for small requests or public interest
- **Success rate:** High for clearly public records (meeting minutes, budgets); low for exempt records (investigations, attorney-client privileged)
- **Response options:** Grant in full, partial grant with redactions, denial with exemption cited, or "no responsive records"
- **Appeal rights:** 30 days to appeal denial to agency head; then Article 78 proceeding in Supreme Court
- **What this achieves:** Legal access to public records; creates record for Article 78 if denied; promotes transparency
- **What this does NOT do:** Provide immediate access; guarantee disclosure of exempt materials; compel agency to create new records; interpret or summarize records

**FOIL Exemptions (POL §87(2)) - Agency can withhold:**

1. **§87(2)(a):** Records specifically exempted by state or federal statute
2. **§87(2)(b):** Records that would constitute unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
3. **§87(2)(c):** Records that would impair contract awards or collective bargaining
4. **§87(2)(d):** Trade secrets and confidential business information
5. **§87(2)(e):** Law enforcement records (if disclosure would interfere with investigation, reveal techniques, endanger life/safety, deprive fair trial)
6. **§87(2)(f):** Records that endanger life or safety of any person
7. **§87(2)(g):** Inter-agency or intra-agency materials (deliberative process) - most commonly claimed
8. **§87(2)(h):** Examination questions or answers used for licensing/employment

**Fee Waiver Criteria (POL §87(1)(b)(iii)):**

- Disclosure primarily benefits general public by contributing to understanding of government operations
- Requester is news media, educational institution, or representative of public interest
- Financial hardship of requester
- Nominal cost (agencies often waive fees under $5-$10)

**Alternatives to FOIL:**

- **Judicial records:** CPLR §5017(b) request to court clerk; 22 NYCRR §216.1 (public access to court records)
- **Subpoena in litigation:** CPLR §3101 discovery; CPLR §2307 subpoena duces tecum if records needed for pending case
- **Open Meetings Law:** Public Officers Law §103-111 (attend public meetings; get meeting minutes)
- **Environmental records:** 6 NYCRR Part 616 (SEQR public access); Environmental Notice Bulletin
- **Direct request:** Many records available on agency websites without formal FOIL

**Best practice:** Start with informal request to FOIL officer or records access officer; be very specific in description of records (dates, subject, parties); request fee waiver if applicable; cite public interest benefit; preserve acknowledgment and responses for appeal; if denied, file administrative appeal within 30 days; if appeal denied, consider Article 78 proceeding in Supreme Court.
