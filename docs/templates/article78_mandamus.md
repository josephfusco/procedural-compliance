# VERIFIED PETITION FOR ARTICLE 78 MANDAMUS RELIEF

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Article 78 Mandamus

**USE this template when:**
- Public officer or court has clear legal duty to perform specific ministerial act
- The duty is mandatory ("shall" language in statute/rule), not discretionary ("may")
- Officer refuses or fails to perform despite demands
- All other remedies (notices, motions, administrative appeals) have been exhausted
- You need court order compelling performance of the duty

**DO NOT use this if:**
- The duty is discretionary (requires judgment or policy decision)
- You haven't exhausted other remedies (notices of non-compliance, motions)
- You're challenging merits of a decision (that's appeal, not mandamus)
- You're within 4-month statute of limitations for direct appeal
- Issue involves complex factual disputes requiring trial

**Appropriate example:** Court decided motion orally 8 months ago but refuses to issue written order required by CPLR §2219(a); you served notices of non-compliance; filed omnibus notice; no written order issued; need order for appellate review.

**Inappropriate example:** Judge denied your motion and you think decision was wrong (that's appeal or motion to reargue, not mandamus - you're challenging exercise of discretion, not failure to perform ministerial duty).

### Try These Steps First

**Before filing Article 78:**

1. **Identify the specific duty** - Cite exact statute/rule requiring the act; confirm duty is ministerial
2. **Serve notice of non-compliance** - Use notice templates in this toolkit; demand compliance by specific date
3. **Document refusal** - Keep copies of all notices, responses (or lack thereof)
4. **Exhaust administrative remedies** - File motions, omnibus notices, requests for relief
5. **Verify statute of limitations** - Article 78 has 4-month SOL from accrual (CPLR §217(1)); appeals have different timelines
6. **Consider alternatives** - Appeal, motion to compel, complaint to oversight body
7. **Consult attorney** - Article 78 is complex; requires verified petition, memorandum of law, proper service

**Document everything:** Notices served, dates of oral rulings, motions filed, responses received, statutory provisions violated.

### Resource Requirements & Legal Standards

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** 4-month statute of limitations from when duty should have been performed (CPLR §217(1)); proceeding takes 2-6 months
- **Cost:** Court filing fees ($210 for Supreme Court); service costs; attorney recommended ($2,500-$10,000+)
- **Complexity:** Requires verified petition, memorandum of law, exhibits; must show ministerial duty and exhaustion
- **Success rate:** High if duty is clearly ministerial and exhaustion shown; low if duty is discretionary
- **What this achieves:** Court order directing officer to perform specific act; establishes record for appeal if denied
- **What this does NOT do:** Reverse substantive rulings; award damages; discipline the officer

**Ministerial vs. Discretionary Duty:**

- **Ministerial:** Duty "so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt" (*Holtzman v. Goldman*, 71 N.Y.2d 564 (1988))
  - Examples: Issue written order (CPLR §2219(a)); enter judgment on docket; provide court records (CPLR §5017(b))
  - No judgment, policy decision, or weighing of factors required
  - "Shall" language in statute/rule
- **Discretionary:** Requires judgment, policy determination, weighing competing considerations
  - Examples: Grant/deny motion; fashion relief; manage calendar
  - NOT subject to mandamus (remedy is appeal or motion to reargue)

**Exhaustion Requirement:**

- Must exhaust available administrative remedies before Article 78
- Serve notices of non-compliance using templates in this toolkit
- File motions, omnibus notices, or administrative appeals
- Exception: Exhaustion excused if remedy is inadequate or futile

**Alternatives to Article 78:**

- **Appeal:** If decision is appealable and within time limits (CPLR Article 55)
- **Motion to compel:** Request court order officer to perform duty
- **Administrative complaint:** Judicial conduct complaint, grievance committee
- **Federal court:** 42 U.S.C. §1983 (civil rights violation) if state remedies inadequate
- **Appellate mandamus:** Petition to Appellate Division for writ of mandamus

**Best practice:** Article 78 is last resort after exhausting other remedies. Serve notices of non-compliance first; file motions; document refusals. Verify duty is ministerial (not discretionary). Consult attorney for complex proceedings. File within 4-month statute of limitations.

## VERIFIED PETITION

Petitioner {{Name}}, by {{pro se / counsel}}, respectfully alleges:

### I. NATURE OF PROCEEDING

1. This is a proceeding pursuant to CPLR Article 78 to compel respondent to perform a ministerial duty required by law: {{specific duty - e.g., "issue written orders pursuant to CPLR §2219(a)" / "provide access to court records under CPLR §5017(b)"}}.

2. Despite multiple demands over {{X}} months, respondent has refused or failed to perform this statutory obligation.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to CPLR §7804(b), which authorizes mandamus relief to compel performance of a duty enjoined by law upon a public officer.

4. Venue is proper in {{County}} County under CPLR §7804(b) as respondent's principal office is located in this county.

### III. PARTIES

5. Petitioner {{Name}} is {{description - party in underlying case, member of public, etc.}} and has a clear legal right to respondent's performance of the duty at issue.

6. Respondent {{Name}} is {{Title - e.g., "Justice of the Supreme Court" / "County Clerk" / "Commissioner"}}, with principal offices at {{Address}}, County of {{County}}, State of New York.

7. Respondent has a ministerial duty under {{Statute}} to {{specific duty}}.

### IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

**Underlying Proceedings**

8. {{Brief description of underlying case or matter}}.

9. The underlying matter is captioned {{Caption}}, Index No. {{Number}}, currently {{pending/concluded}} in {{Court}}.

**Actions Requiring Compliance**

10. On {{date}}, {{event requiring respondent's action occurred - e.g., "the court decided Motion No. 3 orally without issuing written order"}}.

11. On {{date}}, {{additional event}}.

[Continue chronologically with all relevant events]

**Demands for Compliance**

15. On {{date}}, petitioner served respondent with notice of non-compliance demanding compliance with {{statute}} (Exhibit A).

16. Respondent did not respond or comply within the {{X}} business days requested.

17. On {{date}}, petitioner served second demand (Exhibit B).

18. Respondent again failed to comply.

19. On {{date}}, petitioner {{filed motion / submitted omnibus notice / other remedy}} (Exhibit C).

20. Respondent {{denied motion / ignored submission / other response}}.

**Current Status**

21. As of {{date}}, respondent has still not performed the required duty.

22. Petitioner has exhausted all available remedies short of Article 78.

### V. LEGAL ARGUMENT

#### POINT I: MANDAMUS IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY

23. Mandamus lies to compel performance of a ministerial duty required by law. CPLR §7803(1); *Kolisnyk v. County of Monroe*, 34 N.Y.3d 1092 (2020).

24. To obtain mandamus, petitioner must demonstrate: (1) a clear legal right to the relief sought; (2) respondent's duty to perform is ministerial and not discretionary; and (3) no adequate alternative remedy exists. *Matter of Holtzman v. Goldman*, 71 N.Y.2d 564, 572 (1988).

25. All three elements are satisfied here.

#### POINT II: RESPONDENT'S DUTY IS MINISTERIAL

26. {{Statute}} requires respondent to {{duty}}. [Quote relevant statutory language.]

27. This duty is ministerial because it is "so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt." *Matter of Holtzman*, 71 N.Y.2d at 572.

28. The statute uses mandatory language: "shall {{action}}." This leaves no discretion.

29. [Analysis showing no discretion involved - duty is purely administrative/ministerial, not requiring judgment or policy determination.]

30. Courts have uniformly held that {{type of duty}} is ministerial. *[Supporting cases]*.

#### POINT III: PETITIONER HAS CLEAR LEGAL RIGHT

31. Petitioner has a clear statutory right under {{Statute}} to respondent's performance of this duty.

32. {{Statute}} creates an enforceable obligation running to {{petitioner's status - e.g., "parties in litigation" / "members of the public" / "litigants seeking appellate review"}}.

33. [Explanation of why petitioner specifically has standing and right to this relief.]

#### POINT IV: NO ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE REMEDY

34. Petitioner has exhausted all alternative remedies, including:
    - Procedural enclosures served {{dates}} (Exhibits A-B)
    - {{Motion / Omnibus notice / other remedy}} filed {{date}} (Exhibit C)
    - {{Additional efforts}}

35. [Explain why appeal, motion, or other remedies are inadequate or unavailable - e.g., "No appealable order exists because respondent refuses to issue written order" / "Motion procedures have been exhausted without success"]

36. Absent mandamus relief, petitioner has no remedy for respondent's continued non-compliance.

#### POINT V: IRREPARABLE HARM

37. Respondent's failure to perform causes petitioner irreparable harm:
    - {{Harm 1 - e.g., "Prevents meaningful appellate review of adverse ruling"}}
    - {{Harm 2 - e.g., "Violates due process rights to written findings"}}
    - {{Harm 3 - e.g., "Indefinitely delays resolution of underlying matter"}}

38. These harms cannot be remedied by money damages and are ongoing.

### VI. PRIOR DEMANDS AND EXHAUSTION

39. Petitioner has made the following good-faith efforts to obtain compliance:

| Date | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| {{Date}} | Procedural enclosure served | No response |
| {{Date}} | Second enclosure | Ignored |
| {{Date}} | {{Motion/other}} | Denied without explanation |

40. Petitioner has exhausted all reasonable alternatives. Mandamus is the only remaining remedy.

### VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Issue an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue, returnable on the earliest available date;

B. After hearing, issue a writ of mandamus directing respondent to {{specific action - e.g., "issue written orders pursuant to CPLR §2219(a) for Motion Nos. 3, 5, and 7 within fourteen (14) days"}};

C. Award costs and disbursements to petitioner pursuant to CPLR §8101;

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
