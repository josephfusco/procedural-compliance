# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE — ATTORNEY FOR THE CHILD

**[NY][FCA] Demand for Zealous Representation and Communication**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Notice to Attorney for the Child

**USE this template when:**
- AFC has not met with the child they represent despite reasonable time passing
- AFC has not filed position statements or communicated child's wishes to court
- AFC missed court appearances or failed to participate in proceedings
- AFC appears to be acting as law guardian (best interests) when appointed as AFC (expressed wishes)
- You need to create record of AFC's failure to fulfill statutory duties

**DO NOT use this if:**
- AFC is fulfilling duties but you disagree with child's expressed position
- AFC is properly advocating for child's best interests when role is law guardian
- This is first instance of concern (try informal communication first)
- Child is unable to express wishes and AFC appropriately switched to best interests standard
- AFC's strategy differs from yours but is within professional judgment

**Appropriate example:** AFC appointed 4 months ago; no documented meeting with child; no position statement filed; missed last two hearings.

**Inappropriate example:** AFC is advocating for child's wish to stay with non-custodial parent and you disagree with that outcome.

### Try These Steps First

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Review appointment order** to confirm role (AFC vs. law guardian)
2. **Contact AFC directly** via email/phone expressing concerns
3. **Ask child** if AFC has met with them or explained role
4. **Document failures** (missed appearances, lack of filings, no communication)
5. **Raise issue in court** at next appearance before sending formal notice
6. **Consult FCA §§241-249** to confirm actual violation of duties

**Document everything:** Court dates, attempted contacts, child's statements about meetings.

### Resource Requirements & Consequences

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** AFC may respond within days; court may address at next appearance
- **Child impact:** May affect child's case if AFC remains ineffective
- **Relationship:** May damage cooperation between parties and AFC
- **Court discretion:** Judge may or may not remove/replace AFC based on this notice
- **What this achieves:** Creates record for appeal; may prompt AFC to fulfill duties; supports motion to replace
- **What this does NOT do:** Automatically remove AFC; guarantee new counsel; change child's expressed wishes

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Raise directly in court:** Ask judge to inquire about AFC's compliance at next appearance
- **Motion to replace counsel:** If AFC abandonment is clear and ongoing
- **Grievance complaint:** For serious misconduct (use Attorney Grievance template)
- **Consult with your attorney:** If you're represented, have them address with court

**Best practice:** Use this after informal attempts fail and AFC's non-compliance is documented and ongoing; preserves record for appeal and supports motion to replace if needed.
