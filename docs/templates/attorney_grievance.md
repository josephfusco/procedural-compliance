# ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMPLAINT

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Attorney Grievance Complaint

**USE this template when:**
- Attorney committed serious professional misconduct (not mere mistakes or strategy disagreements)
- Violations of NY Rules of Professional Conduct (22 NYCRR Part 1200) are clear and documented
- You've attempted to resolve directly with attorney without success
- Pattern of misconduct (multiple violations or ongoing refusal to comply with professional duties)
- Violations harm clients, court system, or public confidence in legal profession

**DO NOT use this if:**
- You disagree with attorney's strategy or tactics (that's not misconduct)
- Attorney made isolated mistake in judgment (unless gross negligence/incompetence)
- This is primarily a fee dispute (use fee arbitration instead - 22 NYCRR Part 137)
- You want different attorney (file motion to substitute counsel or request withdrawal)
- Attorney vigorously advocated position you disagree with (that's their job)
- You're unhappy with case outcome but attorney acted professionally

**Appropriate example:** Retained attorney who never appeared at hearings, didn't file required papers, missed statute of limitations, never returned calls despite 20+ attempts over 6 months, and failed to withdraw when you requested; documented pattern of neglect violating RPC 1.3 (diligence) and 1.4 (communication).

**Inappropriate example:** Attorney filed motion you think was weak and judge denied it (that's strategy disagreement and adverse outcome, not professional misconduct).

### Try These Steps First

**Before filing grievance complaint:**

1. **Contact attorney directly** - Send email/letter detailing concerns; request meeting to discuss
2. **Request performance** - Demand specific actions (return files, appear at hearing, file papers) by specific date
3. **Request withdrawal** - If relationship broken, request attorney withdraw and return retainer/files
4. **Fee arbitration** - If fee dispute, file for arbitration (22 NYCRR Part 137) - mandatory for attorney if you request
5. **Contact supervising attorney** - If associate/junior attorney, contact firm partner or managing attorney
6. **Document everything** - Keep copies of retainer agreement, communications, missed deadlines, court orders
7. **Consult bar association** - Many have ethics hotlines for guidance on whether conduct constitutes misconduct

**Document everything:** Retainer agreement, fee payments, communications (emails, voicemails), missed appearances, court orders showing attorney failures, timeline of events.

### Resource Requirements & Disciplinary Process

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** Investigation takes months to years; no guarantee of quick resolution or interim relief
- **Confidentiality:** Complaints are confidential until formal charges filed (22 NYCRR §1240.8(a))
- **Attorney will know:** Attorney will be notified of complaint and given opportunity to respond
- **Success rate:** Varies; clear violations with documentation succeed; isolated incidents or judgment calls rarely result in discipline
- **What this achieves:** Accountability; potential discipline (admonition, censure, suspension, disbarment); creates record
- **What this does NOT do:** Get you money back; reverse case outcome; guarantee new attorney; provide immediate relief
- **Consequences:** Attorney may withdraw from representation; relationship irreparably damaged

**Disciplinary Range (from least to most severe):**

1. **Dismissal** - No misconduct found or insufficient evidence
2. **Letter of education** - Informal guidance; no public record
3. **Letter of caution** - Informal warning; no public record
4. **Private admonition** - Formal discipline; not public
5. **Public censure** - Published discipline; serious misconduct
6. **Suspension** - License suspended for period; very serious
7. **Disbarment** - License revoked; most serious misconduct

**Common RPC Violations That Warrant Grievance:**

- **RPC 1.1 (Competence):** Gross negligence, inadequate preparation, ignorance of basic law
- **RPC 1.3 (Diligence):** Pattern of missing deadlines, failing to appear, neglecting case
- **RPC 1.4 (Communication):** Prolonged failure to respond, no status updates, unreachable
- **RPC 1.5 (Fees):** Excessive fees, no written retainer, charging for work not done
- **RPC 1.15 (Safekeeping Property):** Misappropriating client funds, commingling accounts
- **RPC 3.3 (Candor to Tribunal):** Lying to court, fabricating evidence, false statements
- **RPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty):** Fraud, deceit, misrepresentation to client or others

**Alternatives to Grievance Complaint:**

- **Fee arbitration:** Mandatory if you request (22 NYCRR Part 137); resolves fee disputes
- **Legal malpractice suit:** If attorney negligence caused damages; file in Supreme Court
- **Motion to substitute counsel:** Request new attorney be appointed (if assigned counsel)
- **Request for withdrawal:** Attorney must seek court permission to withdraw (22 NYCRR §1215.19)
- **Complaint to firm:** If attorney is associate, contact managing partner
- **Bar association mediation:** Some bar associations offer attorney-client mediation

**Best practice:** Attempt to resolve directly first; document pattern of misconduct (not isolated errors); file grievance only for serious violations of professional duties; consider fee arbitration for fee disputes; consult with another attorney about whether conduct warrants grievance. Filing during active representation may cause attorney to withdraw.
