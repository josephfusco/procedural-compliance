# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE (Universal)

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Universal Notice of Non-Compliance

**USE this template when:**
- You need to address multiple roles or recipients with common procedural failures
- Specific role template doesn't exist for your situation
- Court actor violated clear statutory or rule-based duty
- You need flexible template adaptable to various procedural deficiencies
- Creating record for multiple related compliance issues

**DO NOT use this if:**
- More specific template exists (judge, AFC, clerk, counsel - use those instead)
- Duty is unclear or disputed
- You haven't tried informal resolution
- Complaint is about case outcome rather than procedural compliance
- Issue requires substantive motion rather than notice

**Appropriate example:** Multiple court actors (clerk and court attorney) failed to enter orders and provide case file access; need single comprehensive notice.

**Inappropriate example:** You lost your motion and want to complain generally about the process (use appeal or specific remedy instead).

### Preparation Steps

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Check if specific template exists** (judge, AFC, assigned counsel, clerk, opposing counsel)
2. **Identify specific statute/rule violated** with citation
3. **Document the failure** with dates, docket references, attempts to resolve
4. **Attempt informal resolution** appropriate to recipient's role
5. **Customize role module** from template to match your situation
6. **Verify proper service method** for recipient

**Document everything:** Statutory requirements, timeline of non-compliance, your attempts to resolve.

### Resource Requirements & Customization

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Customization required:** This is framework template requiring significant adaptation
- **Legal research needed:** Must identify specific duties and authorities
- **Less established:** Specific templates (judge, counsel, etc.) have more case law support
- **Flexibility vs. precision:** More adaptable but less tailored than role-specific templates
- **What this achieves:** Creates record for various procedural failures; preserves appeal issues
- **What this does NOT do:** Provide detailed role-specific guidance; guarantee success

**When to use specific templates instead:**
- **Judge:** Use notice_judge.md for written order demands
- **AFC:** Use notice_afc.md for attorney for child issues
- **Assigned Counsel:** Use notice_assigned_counsel.md for representation failures
- **Clerk:** Use notice_clerk.md for record-keeping issues
- **Opposing Counsel:** Use notice_opposing_counsel.md for discovery/ethics violations

**Appropriate use cases for universal template:**
- Court reporter failed to produce transcript
- Court-appointed evaluator violated procedural rules
- Multiple actors with related failures
- Unique role not covered by specific templates

**Best practice:** Prefer specific templates when available; use universal only when necessary; heavily customize role modules and authorities to your specific situation.
