# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE (Universal)

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use Universal Notice of Non-Compliance

**USE this template when:**
- You need to address multiple roles or recipients with common procedural failures
- Specific role template doesn't exist for your situation
- Court actor violated clear statutory or rule-based duty
- You need flexible template adaptable to various procedural deficiencies
- Creating record for multiple related compliance issues

**DO NOT use this if:**
- More specific template exists (judge, AFC, clerk, counsel - use those instead)
- Duty is unclear or disputed
- You haven't tried informal resolution
- Complaint is about case outcome rather than procedural compliance
- Issue requires substantive motion rather than notice

**Appropriate Examples:**

✅ **USE Universal Template:**
1. **Court reporter won't produce transcript:** Reporter missed 90-day deadline (CPLR §8003); judge/AFC/clerk templates don't apply; need notice to court reporter directly
2. **Court-appointed evaluator violated procedure:** Forensic psychologist in custody case disclosed confidential information violating 22 NYCRR Part 36; unique role not covered by other templates
3. **Multiple actors with related failures:** Court clerk failed to docket orders AND court attorney refused to calendar motion; single comprehensive notice more efficient than two separate ones
4. **Interpreter failed to appear:** Court interpreter no-showed at hearing violating Judiciary Law §390; caused adjournment; need formal notice for record
5. **Court attorney exceeded authority:** Court attorney staff denied motion papers claiming "judge won't consider this" - exceeded ministerial role; not judicial act subject to judge template
6. **Special referee violated procedure:** Referee appointed under CPLR §4311 failed to hold hearings as ordered; unique quasi-judicial role
7. **Guardian ad litem (not AFC):** Adult incapacitated person's GAL failed statutory duties under MHL Article 81; different from AFC template

❌ **DO NOT Use Universal Template:**
1. Judge decided motion orally without written order → **Use notice_judge.md** (specific template exists)
2. Opposing counsel won't respond to discovery → **Use notice_opposing_counsel.md** (specific template)
3. Clerk rejected your NYSCEF filing → **Use ny_nyscef_violations.md** (specialized template)
4. Attorney for child hasn't met with child → **Use notice_afc.md** (role-specific template)
5. You lost your motion and disagree with outcome → **Use notice_of_appeal.md** (this is appeal, not compliance issue)
6. Duty is disputed ("Judge says oral ruling sufficient") → **Use Article 78 after building record** (universal notice won't resolve legal dispute)

### Try These Steps First

**Before sending this notice:**

1. **Verify no specific template exists**
   - Check all 6 role-specific templates: judge, AFC, assigned counsel, clerk, opposing counsel, universal
   - Review specialized templates: NYSCEF violations, emergency stay, notice of appeal
   - If specific template exists, use that instead (better case law support)

2. **Identify specific statute/rule violated**
   - Must cite exact CPLR, DRL, FCA, or 22 NYCRR provision
   - Example: "CPLR §8003(a) requires court reporter to deliver transcript within 90 days"
   - If duty is only in case law or general equity, universal notice is weaker

3. **Determine if duty is ministerial or discretionary**
   - **Ministerial:** "So plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt" (*Holtzman*)
   - **Discretionary:** Requires judgment, policy determination, weighing factors
   - Universal notice only works for ministerial duties

4. **Document the failure thoroughly**
   - Dates: When duty should have been performed, when you demanded compliance
   - Docket references: NYSCEF entries, motion sequence numbers
   - Communications: Emails, letters, phone calls requesting performance
   - Build table showing timeline of non-compliance

5. **Attempt informal resolution first**
   - **For court personnel:** Email chambers, call clerk's office, speak to supervisor
   - **For appointed professionals:** Contact directly, request meeting, send informal letter
   - **For multiple actors:** Try to resolve each separately before combined notice
   - **Document all attempts:** Save emails, note phone calls, keep correspondence

6. **Customize role module from template**
   - See Section "Role Modules" below for judge/clerk/counsel/other frameworks
   - Replace {{placeholders}} with specific facts
   - Add citations for role-specific duties
   - Remove irrelevant modules

7. **Verify proper service method**
   - **Court personnel:** NYSCEF upload + email to chambers (check local rules)
   - **Attorneys:** NYSCEF service on attorney's email service address
   - **Non-attorneys:** Certified mail + regular mail
   - **Multiple recipients:** Serve all; file one copy with court

**Document everything:** Statutory requirements, timeline of non-compliance, your attempts to resolve, communications, docket entries.

### Resource Requirements & Customization

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Customization required:** This is framework template requiring significant adaptation (not fill-in-the-blank)
- **Legal research needed:** Must independently research and cite specific duties and authorities for your situation
- **Less established:** Specific templates have more case law support; universal template is newer remedy
- **Timeline:** Varies by recipient; court personnel may respond in days; professionals may take weeks
- **Success rate:** Moderate; depends on clarity of duty and strength of exhaustion showing
- **Flexibility vs. precision:** More adaptable but less tailored than role-specific templates
- **What this achieves:** Creates record for various procedural failures; preserves appeal issues; may prompt compliance
- **What this does NOT do:** Provide detailed role-specific guidance; guarantee success; replace need for motions/appeals

**Cost Expectations:**
- **Filing fees:** Usually $0 (notices not typically filed separately; attached to motions if needed)
- **Service costs:** Certified mail ~$10; NYSCEF free
- **Attorney consultation recommended:** $200-500 for review if complex role/duty
- **Time investment:** 3-5 hours to research, customize, and serve

**When to use specific templates instead:**

| Situation | Correct Template | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Judge won't issue written orders | notice_judge.md | CPLR §2219(a) case law well-established |
| AFC hasn't met with child | notice_afc.md | FCA §§241-249 specific to AFC duties |
| Assigned counsel not communicating | notice_assigned_counsel.md | RPC 1.4 clear; IAC preservation language |
| Clerk won't docket/enter orders | notice_clerk.md | CPLR §5017(b) ministerial duty case law |
| Opposing counsel discovery abuse | notice_opposing_counsel.md | CPLR Article 31 + RPC 3.4 framework |
| NYSCEF rejection/tech issues | ny_nyscef_violations.md | Uniform Rule 202.5-bb specific |

**Appropriate use cases for universal template:**

1. **Court Reporter Failures**
   - Missed CPLR §8003 90-day transcript deadline
   - Refused to produce transcript despite payment
   - Produced incomplete/inaccurate transcript
   - *Why universal:* No court reporter-specific template exists

2. **Court-Appointed Professional Violations**
   - Forensic evaluator (22 NYCRR Part 36 violations)
   - Neutral evaluator in matrimonial (22 NYCRR §202.16(f))
   - Special referee (CPLR §4311) procedural failures
   - Guardian ad litem for incapacitated person (MHL Art. 81)
   - *Why universal:* Quasi-judicial/professional roles not covered elsewhere

3. **Multiple Actors with Related Failures**
   - Clerk + Court Attorney both failed to process motions
   - Judge + Referee both failed to issue required findings
   - AFC + Attorney + GAL all failed to appear at hearing
   - *Why universal:* Single comprehensive notice more efficient

4. **Unique Court Personnel**
   - Court interpreter violations (Judiciary Law §390)
   - Court security refusal to permit access
   - Court IT refusing CM/ECF access despite eligibility
   - Part clerk refusing to accept filing
   - *Why universal:* Ministerial duties exist but no specific template

5. **Hybrid Roles**
   - Law guardian acting as AFC (role confusion)
   - Magistrate performing judicial functions without authority
   - Court attorney making substantive rulings
   - *Why universal:* Role doesn't fit cleanly into other categories

**Best practice:**

1. **Always prefer specific templates when available** - They have better case law support and are more likely to succeed
2. **Use universal only when necessary** - When no other template fits or multiple actors involved
3. **Heavily customize role modules and authorities** - This is framework, not fill-in-the-blank form
4. **Cite specific duties with precision** - Vague "failed to perform duties" won't work; need exact statute/rule
5. **Build strong exhaustion record** - 2-3 informal demands over time showing good faith
6. **Consider motion as alternative** - If duty is disputed or complex, motion to compel may be better remedy
7. **Preserve for appeal/Article 78** - Even if compliance not achieved, notice creates record for escalation
