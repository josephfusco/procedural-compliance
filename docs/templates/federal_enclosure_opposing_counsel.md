**Violation 1: Failure to Comply with Discovery Obligations (FRCP 26, Model Rule 3.4)**

Pursuant to FRCP 26(a) and Model Rule 3.4(d):

- **Initial Disclosures:** FRCP 26(a)(1) required initial disclosures within 14 days of FRCP 26(f) conference. Conference occurred {{date}}. No disclosures received as of {{date}} ({{X}} days overdue).

**Effect:**

- Unable to prepare for {{deposition / summary judgment / trial}} without responses
- Client's ability to present case severely prejudiced
- Pattern of delay and obstruction

**Violation 2: Misrepresentations to Court (Model Rule 3.3, FRCP 11)**

Model Rule 3.3(a) prohibits false statements of fact or law to a tribunal:

On {{date}}, you {{filed brief / made oral representation / submitted declaration}} stating: "{{Quote false statement}}"

This statement is false because:
- {{Reason 1 - cite to record, exhibits, or other evidence}}
- {{Reason 2}}

{{If applicable:}} You knew or should have known this was false because {{your prior filings / deposition testimony / documents in your possession / publicly available records}} contradict this statement.

This violates:
- Model Rule 3.3(a)(1): Knowingly making false statement of fact
- FRCP 11(b)(3): Factual contentions have evidentiary support
- FRCP 11(b)(2): Legal contentions warranted by existing law

**Violation 3: Failure to Disclose Controlling Adverse Authority (Model Rule 3.3(a)(2))**

Model Rule 3.3(a)(2) requires disclosure of controlling adverse legal authority not disclosed by opposing counsel.

In your {{brief / memorandum}} filed {{date}} (ECF No. {{X}}), you argued {{legal position}}.

You failed to disclose the following controlling adverse authority:

1. **{{Case Name}}**, {{Citation}} ({{Court}}, {{Year}}): {{Holding directly contrary to your argument}}

2. **{{Statute/Rule}}**: {{Statutory provision contradicting your position}}

This authority is:
- **Controlling** in this Circuit/District
- **Directly on point** to the issue briefed
- **Adverse** to your client's position
- **Not disclosed** by opposing counsel (me/my client)

Failure to cite this authority violates Model Rule 3.3(a)(2) duty of candor to tribunal.

**Violation 4: Improper Ex Parte Contact (Model Rule 3.5)**

Model Rule 3.5(b) prohibits ex parte communications with judge regarding merits of proceeding.

On {{date}}, you {{communicated with chambers / sent letter to judge / contacted clerk regarding substantive matter}} without notice to opposing counsel.

{{Describe ex parte contact - attach evidence if possible}}

This violates:
- Model Rule 3.5(b): Ex parte communication with judge
- Local Rule {{X}}: Procedures for contacting chambers
- Due process rights of opposing party

**Violation 5: {{Additional Violations - Select as Applicable}}**

**Model Rule 3.4(a) - Obstruction of Access to Evidence:**
{{Example: Instructed client to destroy documents / concealed evidence / obstructed access to witnesses}}

**Model Rule 3.4(c) - Frivolous Discovery:**
{{Example: Served 500 interrogatories designed to harass / demanded production of irrelevant documents to impose burden}}

**Model Rule 4.4 - Respecting Rights of Third Persons:**
{{Example: Subpoenaed third-party witness solely to harass / used discovery to embarrass non-party}}

**Model Rule 8.4(c) - Conduct Involving Dishonesty:**

## 4. Legal Authority

**Model Rule 3.3 - Candor Toward the Tribunal**

> "(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:
> (1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal...
> (2) fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel..."

This is a foundational duty. *Nix v. Whiteside*, 475 U.S. 157, 168 (1986): Duty of candor "is essential to the proper functioning of the adversary system."

**Model Rule 3.4 - Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel**

> "A lawyer shall not:
> (a) unlawfully obstruct another party's access to evidence...
> (d) in pretrial procedure... fail to make reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party..."

Discovery abuse is sanctionable. *See* FRCP 37.

**Model Rule 8.4 - Misconduct**

> "(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;
> (d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice..."

Persistent discovery violations, misrepresentations, and obstruction constitute misconduct under Model Rule 8.4.

**Federal Rules of Civil Procedure - FRCP 11**

FRCP 11(b) requires that attorney representations to court are:
- Not presented for improper purpose
- Warranted by existing law or good faith argument for change
- Supported by evidence or likely to have evidentiary support
- Denials based on reasonably based belief or lack of information

Violation subjects attorney to sanctions under FRCP 11(c).

**{{State}} Rules of Professional Conduct**

{{Insert parallel provisions from state RPC if different from Model Rules - particularly if state has adopted different language or additional duties}}

## 5. Record Preservation and Further Relief

This Procedural Enclosure serves as:

- **Formal notice** of professional violations for disciplinary and judicial review
- **Preservation** of objection to misconduct for sanctions motions and appellate review
- **Predicate** for the following relief if compliance is not forthcoming:

**Judicial Remedies:**
1. **FRCP 37 Motion for Discovery Sanctions** (including fees and costs)
2. **FRCP 11 Motion for Sanctions** (misrepresentations to court)
3. **Motion to Strike** pleadings or filings containing false statements
4. **Motion for Default** if discovery obstruction prevents trial preparation
5. **Motion for Contempt** if court orders violated

**Disciplinary Complaints:**
6. **Complaint to {{State}} Bar Disciplinary Committee** for violation of Rules of Professional Conduct
7. **Complaint to {{District Court}} Grievance Committee** (if local rules establish grievance procedures)
8. **Report to {{Circuit}} Judicial Conference** Committee on Lawyer Conduct {{if applicable}}

**Appellate Preservation:**
9. **Include in appellate brief** as pattern of misconduct affecting fairness of proceedings
10. **Cite to this notice** as evidence of knowing violations and bad faith

## 6. Opportunity to Cure

Before filing sanctions motions or disciplinary complaints, I am providing this opportunity to cure violations:

**7-Day Cure Period:**

If you:
1. Comply with all demands in Section 3 within seven (7) business days;
2. Provide written confirmation of compliance; and
3. Cease further violations;

Then I will consider the matter resolved without filing sanctions motions or grievances.

**Failure to Cure:**

If you fail to cure within seven (7) days, I will:
1. File FRCP 37 motion for discovery sanctions
2. File FRCP 11 motion for sanctions (if safe harbor applies)
3. File disciplinary complaint with {{State}} Bar
4. Seek all available relief including attorney's fees and costs

**Safe Harbor (FRCP 11(c)(2)):**

{{If applicable to FRCP 11 violations:}}

Pursuant to FRCP 11(c)(2), this notice provides you with 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged filing before a sanctions motion may be filed. This 21-day safe harbor period runs from service of this notice.

## 7. Service and Filing

This Procedural Enclosure is:

- **Served** on {{Attorney Name}} via {{email / certified mail / CM/ECF}}
- **Served** on all parties via CM/ECF {{or}} **Not filed** (per FRCP 11(c)(2) safe harbor requirement)

**Note:** Pursuant to FRCP 11(c)(2), sanctions motions based on FRCP 11 violations must not be filed until 21 days after service of this notice, giving you opportunity to cure. Discovery sanction motions under FRCP 37 are not subject to safe harbor and may be filed immediately if violations continue.

---

## CONCLUSION

The Rules of Professional Conduct exist to ensure integrity of the adversary system and protect the administration of justice. Your violations of these rules have prejudiced my client's case and undermined the judicial process.

This is a professional courtesy notice providing you opportunity to cure before sanctions motions and disciplinary complaints are filed. I urge you to comply with the demands in Section 3 within seven (7) business days.
