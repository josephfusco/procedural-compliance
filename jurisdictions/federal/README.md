## Federal vs. NY State: Key Differences

| Aspect | NY State (CPLR) | Federal (FRCP) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Written orders** | CPLR §2219(a) - mandatory for all | FRCP 52(a) - findings required in bench trials only |
| **Discovery** | CPLR Art. 31 - demand-based | FRCP 26 - mandatory initial disclosures |
| **Service** | CPLR §308 - personal/substitute | FRCP 4 - broader methods incl. waiver |
| **Motion practice** | CPLR §2214 - specific timing | FRCP 7 - similar but more flexible |
| **Summary judgment** | CPLR §3212 | FRCP 56 - nearly identical standard |
| **Appeals** | CPLR Art. 55 - 30 days | FRAP 4 - 30 days (60 if U.S. party) |
| **Mandamus** | CPLR Art. 78 | 28 U.S.C. §1361; FRAP 21 |

## Federal Procedural Enforcement Strategy

### 1. Written Orders/Findings (Less Stringent than NY)

**FRCP 52(a)** requires findings of fact and conclusions of law only in:
- Bench trials (not jury trials)
- Orders on motions when requested by party

**Unlike NY:** Federal judges have more discretion. FRCP 52(a) is not as strict as CPLR §2219(a).

**Strategy:**
- Request findings under FRCP 52(a) when entitled
- Cite FRCP 52(b) for amended findings
- Appeal inadequate findings as "clearly erroneous" (limited success)

### 2. Due Process Claims (Stronger in Federal Court)

**42 U.S.C. §1983** allows federal suits for constitutional violations:
- Deprivation of due process (14th Amendment)
- No notice or hearing
- Violation of fundamental rights
- State action under color of law

**Use when:**
- State court violated due process
- State remedies exhausted or inadequate
- Constitutional dimension to claim
- Pattern of procedural violations

**Template:** See main repository `/examples/rule65_prelim_injunction_skeleton.md`

### 3. Mandamus (28 U.S.C. §1361; FRAP 21)

**Federal mandamus** is available but narrow:
- Only to compel ministerial duty
- Clear legal right to relief
- No adequate alternative remedy
- Traditional mandamus is "drastic remedy" (*Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct.*, 542 U.S. 367 (2004))

**Appellate mandamus (FRAP 21):**
- During appeal, can seek writ from Circuit
- More common than trial-level mandamus
- Used for interlocutory matters not otherwise appealable

## Abstention Doctrines (When Federal Court May Decline)

### Younger Abstention
Federal courts abstain from interfering in ongoing state proceedings (criminal or certain civil).
*Younger v. Harris*, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).

**Applies when:**
- Ongoing state judicial proceeding
- Important state interest
- Adequate opportunity to raise federal claims in state court

**Exception:** Extraordinary circumstances (bad faith, harassment)

### Pullman Abstention
Abstain when unclear state law question and federal constitutional claim.

### Rooker-Feldman Doctrine
Federal district courts cannot review state court judgments (only U.S. Supreme Court can).
*Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.*, 263 U.S. 413 (1923).

**Implication:** Can't appeal state judgment via §1983 suit. Must raise as federal question before state judgment is final.

## Strategic Considerations: Federal vs. State

### When to Choose Federal Court

**Advantages:**
- Constitutional claims (§1983)

**Disadvantages:**

- Judicial immunity barriers (qualified immunity)
- Less emphasis on procedural technicalities (FRCP 52(a) weaker than CPLR §2219(a))
- May defer to state court processes

### When to Stay in State Court

**Advantages:**
- CPLR §2219(a) stronger than FRCP 52(a)
- Procedural enforcement more robust in NY
- Article 78 mandamus well-established
- Avoid abstention issues

**Disadvantages:**

- Limited injunctive relief against judge
- State appellate process may be slower
