## Expanding to Additional Jurisdictions

### Framework for New Jurisdictions

Each jurisdiction requires:

#### 1. Core Authority Mapping

| NY (CPLR) | Jurisdiction Equivalent |
|-----------|------------------------|
| CPLR Â§2219(a) - Orders must state grounds | [State code] Â§[X] |
| CPLR Article 78 - Mandamus | [State code] - Writ procedure |
| 22 NYCRR Â§202.48(b) - Written decisions | [State rules] Rule [X] |
| CPLR Â§5515 - Notice of appeal | [State appellate rules] |

#### 2. Timing Differences

- Notice of appeal: 30 days (NY) vs. [X days] (State)
- Motion response time
- Discovery deadlines
- Statute of limitations

#### 3. Local Variations

- E-filing systems (NYSCEF vs. state equivalent)
- Service methods
- Court structure (trial â†’ appellate)
- Motion practice norms

### Template Adaptation Process

**Step 1:** Copy relevant NY template
**Step 2:** Replace citations:
- `CPLR Â§` â†’ `[State Code] Â§`
- `22 NYCRR Â§` â†’ `[State Rules]`
- NY case law â†’ State case law

**Step 3:** Adjust procedures:
- Timing requirements
- Service methods
- Filing procedures

**Step 4:** Verify with local counsel or bar resources
