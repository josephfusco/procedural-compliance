## MEMORANDUM OF LAW

### I. Introduction

Plaintiff {{name}} seeks preliminary injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm arising from the {{state court name}} order dated {{date}}, which {{describe order: e.g., "terminated parental rights without notice," "entered custody order without hearing"}}.

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331 (federal question) and §1343 (civil rights). Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §1391.

---

### II. Standard for Preliminary Injunction

A preliminary injunction is warranted when the moving party shows:

1. **Likelihood of success on the merits**
2. **Irreparable harm absent the injunction**
3. **Balance of equities favors the movant**
4. **Public interest supports the injunction**

*Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.*, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).

---

### III. Likelihood of Success on the Merits

#### A. Procedural Due Process Violation (42 U.S.C. §1983)

The state court order violates procedural due process because:

- **No notice:** Plaintiff received no {{advance notice / proper service / opportunity to respond}}.
- **No hearing:** The order was entered {{ex parte / without evidentiary hearing / without testimony}}.
- **No findings:** The order contains no findings of fact or conclusions of law as required by {{state or federal rule}}.

*Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), requires notice and hearing before deprivation of {{liberty / property}} interests. The state court provided neither.

#### B. Substantive Due Process Violation

The order infringes fundamental rights to {{family integrity / parent-child relationship / etc.}} without compelling justification or narrow tailoring. *Troxel v. Granville*, 530 U.S. 57 (2000).

#### C. Supremacy Clause (if applicable)

The state order conflicts with {{federal statute, e.g., ICWA, IDEA, etc.}} and is preempted under the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.

**Supporting Case Law:**

- *Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v. VCG Special Opportunities Master Fund Ltd.*, 598 F.3d 30 (2d Cir. 2010): Federal courts may enjoin state proceedings in exceptional circumstances.
- *Duchesne v. Sugarman*, 566 F.2d 817 (2d Cir. 1977): Preliminary injunction appropriate to prevent irreparable harm to parent-child relationship.
- *Kia P. v. McIntyre*, 235 F.3d 749 (2d Cir. 2000): Due process requires notice and hearing before termination of parental rights.

---

### IV. Irreparable Harm

Absent injunctive relief, Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm including:

- {{Loss of parental rights / custody}}
- {{Separation from child}}
- {{Enforcement of unlawful order}}
- {{Deprivation of constitutional rights without remedy}}

Harm to constitutional rights constitutes irreparable injury per se. *Elrod v. Burns*, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).

---

### V. Balance of Equities and Public Interest

- **Balance favors Plaintiff:** Plaintiff's constitutional rights outweigh any administrative burden of staying the state order pending hearing.
- **Public interest:** The public has a strong interest in safeguarding constitutional rights and preventing enforcement of orders issued without due process.

---

## RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

1. **Issue a preliminary injunction** enjoining Defendants from enforcing the {{state court order}} dated {{date}} pending a full hearing on the merits.

2. **Order a hearing** within {{14 / 21}} days for Plaintiff to present evidence and testimony.

3. **Require written findings of fact and conclusions of law** from the state court or this Court addressing the constitutional claims.

4. **Award costs and attorney's fees** pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988 (if represented by counsel).

5. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
