## MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT

### I. Jurisdiction and Procedural Posture

This motion is brought pursuant to CPLR §5704(a), which provides:

> "A party may move, on notice, to vacate, modify or set aside the order \[entered ex parte\]."

On {{date}}, this Court entered an ex parte order {{describe order: e.g., "granting custody to petitioner," "enjoining movant from contact with child"}}, without notice to Movant and without findings of fact or conclusions of law.

---

### II. Legal Standard

#### A. CPLR §5704(a) — Right to Review Ex Parte Orders

CPLR §5704(a) provides an independent right to challenge ex parte orders and obtain a hearing with notice. The statute imposes no threshold burden beyond showing the order was entered without notice.

#### B. CPLR §2214(a) and §2219(a) — Notice and Written Orders

- **CPLR §2214(a):** Motions must be on notice unless statute or rule permits ex parte relief.
- **CPLR §2219(a):** Orders must state grounds and specify papers considered.

#### C. 22 NYCRR §202.7(f) — Ex Parte Applications

Ex parte relief requires:
- Affidavit explaining why notice is not required
- Specific statutory or rule-based authority for ex parte relief
- Findings by the court justifying lack of notice

#### D. 22 NYCRR §202.48(b) — Written Decisions

Decisions on motions must be in writing or on the record, stating grounds and papers considered.

---

### III. The Ex Parte Order Violates CPLR and Due Process

The ex parte order is defective because:

1. **No notice:** Movant received no notice of the application or opportunity to oppose.

2. **No findings:** The order contains no findings of fact, conclusions of law, or grounds for the decision.

3. **No authority cited:** The order does not cite statutory or rule-based authority permitting ex parte relief.

4. **No papers specified:** The order does not identify the papers on which it was based, in violation of CPLR §2219(a).

5. **Due process violation:** The order deprives Movant of {{liberty interest / property interest / parental rights}} without notice and hearing, violating the Due Process Clause. *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).

---

### IV. Movant Is Entitled to Vacatur or Hearing

Under CPLR §5704(a), Movant is entitled to:

- **Vacatur** of the defective ex parte order, **OR**
- **A hearing** with notice and opportunity to present evidence and argument.

The order should be vacated because it was entered without compliance with CPLR §2214(a), §2219(a), and 22 NYCRR §202.7(f).

Alternatively, a full hearing should be ordered to allow Movant to contest the factual and legal basis for the order.

---

### V. Case Law Support

- *Matter of Lache P.*, 212 A.D.3d 879 (2d Dep't 2023): Ex parte orders require statutory authority and findings justifying lack of notice.
- *Matter of Mark C.*, 28 N.Y.3d 279 (2016): Procedural due process requires notice and hearing before deprivation of parental rights.
- *Brown v. City of Syracuse*, 89 A.D.2d 273 (4th Dep't 1982): CPLR §5704(a) provides independent remedy for challenging ex parte orders.

---

## CONCLUSION

The ex parte order violates CPLR procedural requirements and constitutional due process. Movant respectfully requests that this Court vacate the order or, in the alternative, order a hearing on notice with written findings.
