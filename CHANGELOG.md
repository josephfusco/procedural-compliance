- **Project Ethos**: Neutral, judge-proof framework for procedural accountability

#### Templates (21 Total)
**New York Templates (13):**

### Changed

#### Branding

- **Terminology**: Templates described as "documentation framework" not "toolkit"

#### Tone
- Shifted from advocacy-oriented language to neutral, institutional tone
- Emphasized procedural compliance documentation over enforcement
- Added judge-proof language emphasizing PCF as specification, not pleading

### Technical

#### Metadata Schema
All templates follow standardized YAML structure:
```yaml

role: "judge" | "clerk" | "counsel" | "afc" | "oversight" | "procedural" | "universal"
statutes: ["Statute 1", "Statute 2"]
version: "1.0.0"
---
```

#### Governance Model
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
