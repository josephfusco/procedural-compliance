# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE (Universal)

**TO:** {{Name, Title}}
**FROM:** {{Your Name}}
**DATE:** {{Date}}
**CASE:** {{Caption, Index Number}}

**SUBJECT:** Procedural Notice and Demand for Statutory Compliance

---

**NOTE:** This notice assumes good faith and seeks cooperative compliance with procedural requirements. It is not an accusation of misconduct, but a formal request to ensure complete record and proper procedure.

## Important Legal Context

**Procedural compliance is important, but:**
- Courts apply "harmless error" doctrine - not every procedural deviation warrants reversal or sanction
- You must show the violation caused actual prejudice to your case
- Appellate courts balance procedural strictness against substantive justice
- Informal compliance is preferred over formal motion practice

**This notice:**
- Creates a record of the procedural issue
- Requests compliance to avoid appealable error
- Does NOT guarantee relief even if violation occurred

**Recommendation:** Consult an attorney to evaluate whether a procedural issue is material to your case.
