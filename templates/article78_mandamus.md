## VERIFIED PETITION

Petitioner {{Name}}, by {{pro se / counsel}}, respectfully alleges:

### I. NATURE OF PROCEEDING

1. This is a proceeding pursuant to CPLR Article 78 to compel respondent to perform a ministerial duty required by law: {{specific duty - e.g., "issue written orders pursuant to CPLR §2219(a)" / "provide access to court records under CPLR §5017(b)"}}.

2. Despite multiple demands over {{X}} months, respondent has refused or failed to perform this statutory obligation.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to CPLR §7804(b), which authorizes mandamus relief to compel performance of a duty enjoined by law upon a public officer.

4. Venue is proper in {{County}} County under CPLR §7804(b) as respondent's principal office is located in this county.

### III. PARTIES

5. Petitioner {{Name}} is {{description - party in underlying case, member of public, etc.}} and has a clear legal right to respondent's performance of the duty at issue.

6. Respondent {{Name}} is {{Title - e.g., "Justice of the Supreme Court" / "County Clerk" / "Commissioner"}}, with principal offices at {{Address}}, County of {{County}}, State of New York.

7. Respondent has a ministerial duty under {{Statute}} to {{specific duty}}.

### IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

**Underlying Proceedings**

8. {{Brief description of underlying case or matter}}.

9. The underlying matter is captioned {{Caption}}, Index No. {{Number}}, currently {{pending/concluded}} in {{Court}}.

**Actions Requiring Compliance**

10. On {{date}}, {{event requiring respondent's action occurred - e.g., "the court decided Motion No. 3 orally without issuing written order"}}.

11. On {{date}}, {{additional event}}.

[Continue chronologically with all relevant events]

**Demands for Compliance**

15. On {{date}}, petitioner served respondent with procedural enclosure demanding compliance with {{statute}} (Exhibit A).

16. Respondent did not respond or comply within the {{X}} business days requested.

17. On {{date}}, petitioner served second demand (Exhibit B).

18. Respondent again failed to comply.

19. On {{date}}, petitioner {{filed motion / submitted omnibus notice / other remedy}} (Exhibit C).

20. Respondent {{denied motion / ignored submission / other response}}.

**Current Status**

21. As of {{date}}, respondent has still not performed the required duty.

22. Petitioner has exhausted all available remedies short of Article 78.

### V. LEGAL ARGUMENT

#### POINT I: MANDAMUS IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY

23. Mandamus lies to compel performance of a ministerial duty required by law. CPLR §7803(1); *Kolisnyk v. County of Monroe*, 34 N.Y.3d 1092 (2020).

24. To obtain mandamus, petitioner must demonstrate: (1) a clear legal right to the relief sought; (2) respondent's duty to perform is ministerial and not discretionary; and (3) no adequate alternative remedy exists. *Matter of Holtzman v. Goldman*, 71 N.Y.2d 564, 572 (1988).

25. All three elements are satisfied here.

#### POINT II: RESPONDENT'S DUTY IS MINISTERIAL

26. {{Statute}} requires respondent to {{duty}}. [Quote relevant statutory language.]

27. This duty is ministerial because it is "so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt." *Matter of Holtzman*, 71 N.Y.2d at 572.

28. The statute uses mandatory language: "shall {{action}}." This leaves no discretion.

29. [Analysis showing no discretion involved - duty is purely administrative/ministerial, not requiring judgment or policy determination.]

30. Courts have uniformly held that {{type of duty}} is ministerial. *[Supporting cases]*.

#### POINT III: PETITIONER HAS CLEAR LEGAL RIGHT

31. Petitioner has a clear statutory right under {{Statute}} to respondent's performance of this duty.

32. {{Statute}} creates an enforceable obligation running to {{petitioner's status - e.g., "parties in litigation" / "members of the public" / "litigants seeking appellate review"}}.

33. [Explanation of why petitioner specifically has standing and right to this relief.]

#### POINT IV: NO ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE REMEDY

34. Petitioner has exhausted all alternative remedies, including:
    - Procedural enclosures served {{dates}} (Exhibits A-B)
    - {{Motion / Omnibus notice / other remedy}} filed {{date}} (Exhibit C)
    - {{Additional efforts}}

35. [Explain why appeal, motion, or other remedies are inadequate or unavailable - e.g., "No appealable order exists because respondent refuses to issue written order" / "Motion procedures have been exhausted without success"]

36. Absent mandamus relief, petitioner has no remedy for respondent's continued non-compliance.

#### POINT V: IRREPARABLE HARM

37. Respondent's failure to perform causes petitioner irreparable harm:
    - {{Harm 1 - e.g., "Prevents meaningful appellate review of adverse ruling"}}
    - {{Harm 2 - e.g., "Violates due process rights to written findings"}}
    - {{Harm 3 - e.g., "Indefinitely delays resolution of underlying matter"}}

38. These harms cannot be remedied by money damages and are ongoing.

### VI. PRIOR DEMANDS AND EXHAUSTION

39. Petitioner has made the following good-faith efforts to obtain compliance:

| Date | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| {{Date}} | Procedural enclosure served | No response |
| {{Date}} | Second enclosure | Ignored |
| {{Date}} | {{Motion/other}} | Denied without explanation |

40. Petitioner has exhausted all reasonable alternatives. Mandamus is the only remaining remedy.

### VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Issue an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue, returnable on the earliest available date;

B. After hearing, issue a writ of mandamus directing respondent to {{specific action - e.g., "issue written orders pursuant to CPLR §2219(a) for Motion Nos. 3, 5, and 7 within fourteen (14) days"}};

C. Award costs and disbursements to petitioner pursuant to CPLR §8101;

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
