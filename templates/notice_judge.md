# NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE -- JUDGE

**[NY][CPLR] Demand for Written Decision with Findings**

---

**TO:** Hon. {{Judge Name}}, {{Court Title}}<br>
**FROM:** {{Your Name}}, {{Pro Se / Counsel for Party}}<br>
**DATE:** {{Date}}<br>
**CASE:** {{Caption}} | Index No. {{Number}}<br>
**COURT:** {{Court Name and County}}<br>
**SUBJECT:** Demand for Written Order Stating Grounds and Papers Considered

---

**NOTE:** This notice assumes good faith and seeks cooperative compliance with procedural requirements. It is not an accusation of misconduct, but a formal request to ensure complete record and proper procedure.

---

## Important Legal Context

**Understanding Written Order Requirements:**
- CPLR Section 2219(a) primarily applies to dispositive orders and final judgments
- Oral rulings made on the record are often legally sufficient
- Courts have discretion in how they document routine procedural matters
- Not every absence of written findings constitutes reversible error (harmless error doctrine applies)

**This notice requests written orders to:**
- Ensure complete appellate record
- Clarify basis for rulings
- Prevent potential appealable error

**This is NOT:**
- An accusation of judicial misconduct
- A guarantee of relief even if orders are absent
- A substitute for proper appellate procedure

**Recommendation:** If this concerns a final order or dispositive motion, consult an attorney about whether written findings are legally required in your specific situation.
