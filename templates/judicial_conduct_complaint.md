# COMPLAINT TO NY STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT

**[NY] Formal Complaint Pursuant to 22 NYCRR Part 100 (Code of Judicial Conduct)**

---

**WARNING:** This is a formal complaint against a judge that creates a permanent record. Filing during an active case may affect how the judge treats you. Use only after exhausting procedural remedies (appeals, Article 78, procedural enclosures). This should address serious misconduct, not mere disagreement with a decision. Filing a false or frivolous complaint may subject you to sanctions. Consider filing after your case concludes, or consult an attorney first.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

**Timing:**
- File during case: High risk of retaliation; judge may learn of complaint
- File after final judgment: Safer; less impact on outcome
- File after appeal: Safest; case resolved

**Consequences:**
- Creates formal accountability record
- May result in discipline (admonition, censure, removal)
- May affect ongoing proceedings (positively or negatively)
- Relationship with judge irreparably damaged

**Alternatives:**
- Appeal procedural errors (CPLR Article 55)
- Article 78 mandamus (CPLR Article 78)
- Federal court (42 U.S.C. Section 1983)
- Motion for recusal (CPLR Section 4110-4115)

**Use this mechanism only when:**
- Pattern of misconduct (not isolated error)
- Other remedies exhausted or unavailable
- Serious violations of judicial conduct
- Public interest in accountability outweighs personal risk
