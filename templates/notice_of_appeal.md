# NOTICE OF APPEAL

**[NY][CPLR] Appeal to Appellate Division Pursuant to CPLR Article 55**

## WHAT IS THIS?

This is the document you file to start an appeal. An appeal asks a higher court to review a lower court's decision. You typically have 30 days from when you received the order/judgment to file this.

**(In simple terms:** When a judge makes a decision you think is wrong, this letter officially tells the court "I want a higher court to review this."**)**
