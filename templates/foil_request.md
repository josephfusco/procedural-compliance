# FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW REQUEST

**[NY][FOIL] Request for Records Pursuant to Public Officers Law Section 87**

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE

### When to Use FOIL Request

**USE this template when:**
- You need records held by a NY state/local government agency or court
- You have made informal request and need formal statutory process
- You need to establish official timeline and appeal rights
- Agency has denied informal access or not responded
- You need records for litigation, accountability, or public interest purposes

**DO NOT use this if:**
- Records are already publicly available online
- You need urgent access (FOIL has 20+ day timeline)
- This is a federal agency (use FOIA instead)
- An appeal or subpoena is the proper remedy for your case
- You're seeking records exempt from disclosure (personal medical, ongoing investigation, etc.)

**Appropriate example:** Requesting court orders and transcripts from your case that aren't in NYSCEF; agency denied informal email request.

**Inappropriate example:** Requesting opposing party's personal medical records (use discovery subpoena).

### Preparation Steps

**Before filing FOIL request:**

1. **Check if records are already public** (NYSCEF, agency website, public reading room)
2. **Make informal request** (email/call to clerk or agency first)
3. **Be specific** about what you want (dates, case numbers, document types)
4. **Identify correct custodian** (which agency/court department has the records)
5. **Consider costs** (agency may charge for copies; request fee waiver if applicable)

**Document everything:** Keep copies of informal requests and responses for appeal if needed.

### Resource Requirements & Timeline

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

- **Timeline:** 5 business days for acknowledgment; 20 business days for response (or explanation of delay)
- **Cost:** Typically $0.25/page for copies; may request fee waiver for public interest
- **Success rate:** High for clearly public records; low for exempt materials
- **Response options:** Grant access, partial grant with redactions, or denial with explanation
- **Appeal rights:** 30 days to appeal denial to agency head, then Article 78 to court
- **What this achieves:** Legal access to public records; creates record for Article 78 if denied

**Alternatives to consider:**
- **Informal request first:** Often faster and free (email clerk or agency)
- **Court motion:** If you need records for pending case (e.g., motion to compel clerk)
- **Subpoena:** For records in litigation discovery
- **Federal FOIA:** If records are federal (5 U.S.C. §552)

**Best practice:** Start with informal request; use FOIL for formal timeline and appeal rights if denied.

## FEE WAIVER REQUEST

I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request pursuant to Public Officers Law Section 87(1)(b)(iii) and 21 NYCRR Section 1401.9, on the grounds that:

{{Reason for waiver - e.g., "disclosure is in the public interest" / "requester cannot afford fees" / "records relate to ongoing litigation affecting requester's rights"}}
